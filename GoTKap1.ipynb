       "['Kapitel 1.     The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king\\'s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\\'s life.   The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran\\'s skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.   But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king\\'s justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night\\'s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.   The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he\\'d seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.   Bran\\'s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\\'s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.   There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. \"Ice,\" that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man\\'s hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.   His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, \"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die.\" He lifted the greatsword high above his head.   Bran\\'s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \"Keep the pony well in hand,\" he whispered. \"And don\\'t look away. Father will know if you do.\"   Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.   His father took off the man\\'s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.   The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\\'s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away.   \"Ass,\" Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\\'s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \"You did well,\" Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.   It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.   \"The deserter died bravely,\" Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\\'s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \"He had courage, at the least.\"   \"No,\" Jon Snow said quietly. \"It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\" Jon\\'s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.   Robb was not impressed. \"The Others take his eyes,\" he swore. \"He died well. Race you to the bridge?\"   \"Done,\" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.   Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man\\'s eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb\\'s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again.   So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him. \"Are you well, Bran?\" he asked, not unkindly.   \"Yes, Father,\" Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \"Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he was afraid.\"   \"What do you think?\" his father asked.   Bran thought about it. \"Can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\"   \"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" his father told him. \"Do you understand why I did it?\"   \"He was a wildling,\" Bran said. \"They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\"   His lord father smiled. \"Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night\\'s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\"   Bran had no answer for that. \"King Robert has a headsman,\" he said, uncertainly.   \"He does,\" his father admitted. \"As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\\'s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.   \"One day, Bran, you will be Robb\\'s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\"   That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at them. \"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\" Then he was gone again.   Jory rode up beside them. \"Trouble, my lord?\"   \"Beyond a doubt,\" his lord father said. \"Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\" He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after.   They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.   The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground . Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \"Gods!\" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword.   Jory\\'s sword was already out. \"Robb, get away from it!\" he called as his horse reared under him.   Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \"She can\\'t hurt you,\" he said. \"She\\'s dead, Jory.\"   Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran.   By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. \"What in the seven hells is it?\" Greyjoy was saying.   \"A wolf,\" Robb told him.   \"A freak,\" Greyjoy said. \"Look at the size of it.\"   Bran\\'s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers\\' side.   Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\\'s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\\'s kennel.   \"It\\'s no freak,\" Jon said calmly. \"That\\'s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\"   Theon Greyjoy said, \"There\\'s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\"   \"I see one now,\" Jon replied.   Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb\\'s arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb\\'s chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. \"Go on,\" Robb told him. \"You can touch him.\"   Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \"Here you go.\" His half brother put a second pup into his arms. \"There are five of them.\" Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.   \"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\" muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \"I like it not.\"   \"It is a sign,\" Jory said.   Father frowned. \"This is only a dead animal, Jory,\" he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. \"Do we know what killed her?\"   \"There\\'s something in the throat,\" Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even asked. \"There, just under the jaw.\"   His father knelt and groped under the beast\\'s head with his hand. He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.   A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.   His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \"I\\'m surprised she lived long enough to whelp,\" he said. His voice broke the spell.   \"Maybe she didn\\'t,\" Jory said. \"I\\'ve heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came.\"   \"Born with the dead,\" another man put in. \"Worse luck.\"   \"No matter,\" said Hullen. \"They be dead soon enough too.\"   Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.   \"The sooner the better,\" Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \"Give the beast here, Bran.\"   The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \"No!\" Bran cried out fiercely. \"It\\'s mine.\"   \"Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\" Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, like the lord he would someday be. \"We will keep these pups.\"   \"You cannot do that, boy,\" said Harwin, who was Hullen\\'s son.   \"It be a mercy to kill them,\" Hullen said.   Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \"Hullen speaks truly, son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\"   \"No!\" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his father.   Robb resisted stubbornly. \"Ser Rodrik\\'s red bitch whelped again last week,\" he said. \"It was a small litter, only two live pups. She\\'ll have milk enough.\"   \"She\\'ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\"   \"Lord Stark,\" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \"There are five pups,\" he told Father. \"Three male, two female.\"   \"What of it, Jon?\"   \"You have five trueborn children,\" Jon said. \"Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\"   Bran saw his father\\'s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.   Their father understood as well. \"You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\" he asked softly.   \"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\" Jon pointed out. \"I am no Stark, Father.\"   Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \"I will nurse him myself, Father,\" he promised. \"I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\"   \"Me too!\" Bran echoed.   The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \"Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not have you wasting the servants\\' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?\"   Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue.   \"You must train them as well,\" their father said. \"You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip a man\\'s arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?\"  \"Yes, Father,\" Bran said.   \"Yes,\" Robb agreed.   \"The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\"   \"They won\\'t die,\" Robb said. \"We won\\'t let them die.\"   \"Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It\\'s time we were back to Winterfell.\"   It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him.   Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.   \"What is it, Jon?\" their lord father asked.   \"Can\\'t you hear it?\"   Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.   \"There,\" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.   \"He must have crawled away from the others,\" Jon said.   \"Or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.   \"An albino,\" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"This one will die even faster than the others.\"   Jon Snow gave his father\\'s ward a long, chilling look. \"I think not, Greyjoy,\" he said. \"This one belongs to me.\"',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 2.      Catelyn had never liked this godswood.   She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers.   The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names.   But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man\\'s life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood.   Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept.   For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest.   At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold. \"The heart tree,\" Ned called it. The weirwood\\'s bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were true; they had watched the castle\\'s granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea.   In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face.   Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came. \"Ned,\" she called softly.   He lifted his head to look at her. \"Catelyn,\" he said. His voice was distant and formal. \"Where are the children?\"   He would always ask her that. \"In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.\" She spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes watching her, but she did her best to ignore them. \"Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.\"   \"Is he afraid?\" Ned asked.   \"A little,\" she admitted. \"He is only three.\"   Ned frowned. \"He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming.\"   \"Yes,\" Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words. Every noble house had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark words. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were.   \"The man died well, I\\'ll give him that,\" Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. \"I was glad for Bran\\'s sake. You would have been proud of Bran.\"   \"I am always proud of Bran,\" Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been forged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in the North.   \"He was the fourth this year,\" Ned said grimly. \"The poor man was half-mad. Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him.\" He sighed. \"Ben writes that the strength of the Night\\'s Watch is down below a thousand. It\\'s not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as well.\"   \"Is it the wildlings?\" she asked .   \"Who else?\" Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. \"And it will only grow worse. The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all.\"   \"Beyond the Wall?\" The thought made Catelyn shudder.   Ned saw the dread on her face. \"Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.\"   \"There are darker things beyond the Wall.\" She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts.   His smile was gentle. \"You listen to too many of Old Nan\\'s stories. The Others are as dead as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No living man has ever seen one.\"   \"Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,\" Catelyn reminded him.   \"I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,\" he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its sheath. \"You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my lady?\"   Catelyn took her husband\\'s hand. \"There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself.\" There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. \"I am so sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.\"   His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect.   And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully.   \"Jon . . . \" he said. \"Is this news certain?\"   \"It was the king\\'s seal, and the letter is in Robert\\'s own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was taken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain.\"   \"That is some small mercy, I suppose,\" he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he thought first of her. \"Your sister,\" he said. \"And Jon\\'s boy. What word of them?\"   \"The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,\" Catelyn said. \"I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband\\'s place, not hers. Lord Jon\\'s memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends around her.\"   \"Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I\\'d heard.\"   Catelyn nodded. \"Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still . . . \"   \"Go to her,\" Ned urged. \"Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.\"   \"Would that I could,\" Catelyn said. \"The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out.\"   It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. \"Robert is coming here?\" When she nodded, a smile broke across his face.   Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. \"I knew that would please you,\" she said. \"We should send word to your brother on the Wall.\"   \"Yes, of course,\" he agreed. \"Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird.\" Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. \"Damnation, how many years has it been? And he gives us no more notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?\"   \"I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. Cersei and the children travel with them.\"   \"Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,\" he said. \"It is just as well. That will give us more time to prepare.\"   \"The queen\\'s brothers are also in the party,\" she told him.   Ned grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen\\'s family, Catelyn knew. The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert\\'s cause, when victory was all but certain, and he had never forgiven them. \"Well, if the price for Robert\\'s company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.\"   \"Where the king goes, the realm follows,\" she said.   \"It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman\\'s teat the last time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?\"   \"Prince Tommen is seven,\" she told him. \"The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your tongue. The Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.\"   Ned squeezed her hand. \"There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will want to hunt. I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back. Gods, how are we going to feed them all? On his way already, you said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.\"',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 3.      Her brother held the gown up for her inspection. \"This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric.\"   Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could not remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. \"Is it really mine?\"   \"A gift from the Magister Illyrio,\" Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. \"The color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio has promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.\"   A princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. \"Why does he give us so much?\" she asked. \"What does he want from us?\" For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister\\'s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos.   \"Illyrio is no fool,\" Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes. \"The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.\"   Dany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the JadeSea. It was also said that he\\'d never had a friend he wouldn\\'t cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible thing when roused. Viserys called it \"waking the dragon.\"   Her brother hung the gown beside the door. \"Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash off the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of mount.\" He studied her critically. \"You still slouch. Straighten yourself\" He pushed back her shoulders with his hands. \"Let them see that you have a woman\\'s shape now.\" His fingers brushed lightly over her budding br  sts and tightened on a nipple. \"You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. You don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. \"Do you?\" he repeated.  \"No,\" Dany said meekly.   Her brother smiled. \"Good.\" He touched her hair, almost with affection. \"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.\"   When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo\\'s manse.   Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the SunsetKingdoms. Her brother had a simpler name. \"Our land,\" he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \"Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.\"   And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. Viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King\\'s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother\\'s womb.   Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship\\'s black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of King\\'s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper\\'s dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar\\'s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the Kingslayer opened Father\\'s throat with a golden sword.   She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her.   She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper\\'s brother set sail with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast.   She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called her \"Little Princess\" and sometimes \"My Lady,\" and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.   They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper\\'s hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.   At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother\\'s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother \"the beggar king.\" Dany did not want to know what they called her.   \"We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\" he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it. \"The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King\\'s Landing, the Iron Throne and the SevenKingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.\" Viserys lived for that day. All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the childhood she had never known.   There came a soft knock on her door. \"Come,\" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio\\'s servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister\\'s many Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was Illyrio\\'s favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.   They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany\\'s head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. \"Ours is the house of the dragon,\" he would say. \"The fire is in our blood.\"   The old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. \"Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.\" There was more like that, so much more, what a handsome man the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon archer. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian.   When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs.   \"Now you look all a princess,\" the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.   Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. \"Stand there,\" he told her. \"Turn around. Yes. Good. You look . . . \"   \"Regal,\" Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man . Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. \"May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,\" the magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard. \"She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,\" he told her brother. \"Drogo will be enraptured.\"   \"She\\'s too skinny,\" Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent him, and said, \"Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?\"   \"She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal,\" Illyrio told him, not for the first time. \"Look at her. That silver-gold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . . and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.\" When he released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling.   \"I suppose,\" her brother said doubtfully. \"The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep . . . \"   \"Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,\" Illyrio said.   Anger flashed in her brother\\'s lilac eyes. \"Do you take me for a fool?\"   The magister bowed slightly. \"I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I have given offense.\" He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers.   The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio\\'s elaborately carved palanquin. Two servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio\\'s pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes.   Her brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the narrow sea. \"We won\\'t need his whole khalasar,\" Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. \"Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for their king.\" He looked at Illyrio anxiously. \"They do, don\\'t they?\"   \"They are your people, and they love you well,\" Magister Illyrio said amiably. \"In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water.\" He gave a massive shrug. \"Or so my agents tell me.\"   Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrio\\'s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding eagerly, however. \"I shall kill the Usurper myself,\" he promised, who had never killed anyone, \"as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what he did to my father.\"   \"That would be most fitting,\" Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again.   The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told them. The Free Cities were always generous with the horselords. \"It is not that we fear these barbarians,\" Illyrio would explain with a smile. \"The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests promise . . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?\"   Their palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards. He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to him in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates.   Dany noticed that her brother\\'s hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. He looked almost as frightened as she felt. \"Insolent eunuch,\" Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse.   Magister Illyrio\\'s words were honey. \"Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have enemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your head.\"   \"Oh, yes,\" Viserys said darkly. \"He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us everywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.\"   The palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help Daenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet.   Inside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon. They were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. \"Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third of his Name,\" he called in a high, sweet voice, \"King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the SevenKingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.\"   They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many were Dothraki horselords, big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells. Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer Isles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with a sudden start of fear, that she was the only woman there.  Illyrio whispered to them. \"Those three are Drogo\\'s bloodriders, there,\" he said. \"By the pillar is Khal Moro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.\"   The last name caught Daenerys. \"A knight?\"   \"No less.\" Illyrio smiled through his beard. \"Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself.\"   \"What is he doing here?\" she blurted.   \"The Usurper wanted his head,\" Illyrio told them. \"Some trifling affront. He sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night\\'s Watch. Absurd law. A man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel.\"   \"I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,\" her brother said. Dany found herself looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. Instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs.   She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder. \"Over there, sweet princess,\" he whispered, \"there is the khal himself.\"   Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done.   The slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio\\'s menagerie. He was younger than she\\'d thought, no more than thirty. His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings.   \"I must go and make my submissions,\" Magister Illyrio said. \"Wait here. I shall bring him to you.\"   Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt. \"Do you see his braid, sweet sister?\"   Drogo\\'s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs.   \"You see how long it is?\" Viserys said. \"When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids in disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\"   Dany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her. \"I don\\'t want to be his queen,\" she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. \"Please, please, Viserys, I don\\'t want to, I want to go home.\"   \"Home?\" He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. \"How are we to go home, sweet sister? They took our home from us!\" He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into her skin. \"How are we to go home?\" he repeated, meaning King\\'s Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the realm they had lost.   Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio\\'s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her brother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house with the red door had not been home for him. His fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. \"I don\\'t know . . . \"she said at last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes.   \"I do,\" he said sharply. \"We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo\\'s army, that is how we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.\" He smiled at her. \"I\\'d let his whole khalasar f ck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army. Be grateful it is only Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and he will not see you crying.\"   Dany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting Khal Drogo over to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand.   \"Smile,\" Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. \"And stand up straight. Let him see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.\"   Daenerys smiled, and stood up straight.',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 4.      The visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred strong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of Baratheon.   Ned knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister.   Yet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \"Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of yours.\" The king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. \"You have not changed at all.\"   Would that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a throne, the Lord of Storm\\'s End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden\\'s fantasy. Six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his House, he became a veritable giant. He\\'d had a giant\\'s strength too, his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume.   Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. Ned had last seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy\\'s rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the IronIslands. Since the night they had stood side by side in Greyjoy\\'s fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord\\'s surrender and Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes.   Yet Robert was Ned\\'s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \"Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.\"   By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their mounts. Robert\\'s queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. The wheelhouse in which they had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen\\'s ring, while Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, introduced, and approved of by both sides.   No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, \"Take me down to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.\"   Ned loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a lantern. No other words were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been riding since dawn, everyone was tired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more than that; Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she had said no more.   They went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The winding stone steps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. \"I was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell,\" Robert complained as they descended. \"In the south, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.\"   \"I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?\"   Robert snorted. \"Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent inn north of the Neck. I\\'ve never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all your people?\"   \"Likely they were too shy to come out,\" Ned jested. He could feel the chill coming up the stairs, a cold breath from deep within the earth. \"Kings are a rare sight in the north.\"   Robert snorted. \"More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!\" The king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended.   \"Late summer snows are common enough,\" Ned said. \"I hope they did not trouble you. They are usually mild.\"   \"The Others take your mild snows,\" Robert swore. \"What will this place be like in winter? I shudder to think.\"   \"The winters are hard,\" Ned admitted. \"But the Starks will endure. We always have.\"   \"You need to come south,\" Robert told him. \"You need a taste of summer before it flees. In Highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth - melons, peaches, fireplums, you\\'ve never tasted such sweetness. You\\'ll see, I brought you some. Even at Storm\\'s End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can barely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with food, the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is fat and drunk and rich.\" He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. \"And the girls, Ned!\" he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \"I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim na ed in the river, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it\\'s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it\\'s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.\" The king laughed happily.   Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to take his pleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt.   \"Your Grace,\" Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows moved and lurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains. \"She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.\"   He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. It was always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by.   By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn allegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North.   Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children. Ned did not like to think on that. \"Here,\" he told his king.   Robert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head.   There were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned\\'s father, had a long, stern face. The stonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children.   Brandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him die. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule.   Lyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned had loved her with all his heart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have been his bride.   \"She was more beautiful than that,\" the king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on Lyanna\\'s face, as if he could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by his weight. \"Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like this?\" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \"She deserved more than darkness . . . \"   \"She was a Stark of Winterfell,\" Ned said quietly. \"This is her place.\"   \"She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean.\"   \"I was with her when she died,\" Ned reminded the king. \"She wanted to come home, to rest beside Brandon and Father.\" He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled of blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister\\'s eyes. Ned remembered the way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him still holding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. Ned could recall none of it. \"I bring her flowers when I can,\" he said . \"Lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.\"   The king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh. \"I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.\"   \"You did,\" Ned reminded him.   \"Only once,\" Robert said bitterly.  They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The waters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert\\'s hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it. When Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor.   \"In my dreams, I kill him every night,\" Robert admitted. \"A thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves.\"   There was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, \"We should return, Your Grace. Your wife will be waiting.\"   \"The Others take my wife,\" Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his footsteps falling heavily. \"And if I hear \\'Your Grace\\' once more, I\\'ll have your head on a spike. We are more to each other than that.\"   \"I had not forgotten,\" Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, \"Tell me about Jon.\"   Robert shook his head. \"I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourney on my son\\'s name day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. A fortnight later he was dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned right through him.\" He paused beside a pillar, before the tomb of a long-dead Stark. \"I loved that old man.\"   \"We both did.\" Ned paused a moment. \"Catelyn fears for her sister. How does Lysa bear her grief?\"   Robert\\'s mouth gave a bitter twist. \"Not well, in truth,\" he admitted. \"I think losing Jon has driven the woman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave him to be raised by women?\"   Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. \"The wife has lost the husband,\" he said carefully. \"Perhaps the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.\"   \"Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,\" the king swore. \"Lord Tywin had never taken a ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a great and noble House. She refused to even hear of it. Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei was furious.\" He sighed deeply. \"The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am sworn to protect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?\"   \"I will take him as ward, if you wish,\" Ned said. \"Lysa should consent to that. She and Catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.\"   \"A generous offer, my friend,\" the king said, \"but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.\"   \"I have more concern for my nephew\\'s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,\" Ned declared.   \"That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.\" Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard. \"Ah, Ned,\" he said, \"you are still too serious.\" He put a massive arm around Ned\\'s shoulders. \"I had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there\\'s no need for it. Come, walk with me.\"   They started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed. The king kept his arm around Ned\\'s shoulder. \"You must have wondered why I finally came north to Winterfell, after so long.\"   Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. \"For the joy of my company, surely,\" he said lightly. \"And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it. The Night\\'s Watch is a shadow of what it once was. Benjen says - \"   \"No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,\" Robert said. \"The Wall has stood for what, eight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns. These are difficult times. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of the East, as the Hand of the King. He will not be easy to replace.\"   \"His son . . . \" Ned began.   \"His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,\" Robert said brusquely. \"No more.\"   That took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came unbidden. \"The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.\"   \"Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\" Robert said. \"I have this year to think of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.\"   \"In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father\\'s sake if not his own. Surely you owe Jon that much for his service.\"   The king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned\\'s shoulders. \"Jon\\'s service was the duty he owed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men ought to know that. But the son is not the father. A mere boy cannot hold the east.\" Then his tone softened. \"Enough of this. There is a more important office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.\" Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. \"I have need of you, Ned.\"   \"I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.\" They were words he had to say, and so he said them, apprehensive about what might come next.   Robert scarcely seemed to hear him. \"Those years we spent in the Eyrie . . . gods, those were good years. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King\\'s Landing, not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody.\" Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment as melancholy as a Stark. \"I swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse. And the people . . . there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw. They all want something, money or land or justice. The lies they tell . . . and my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by flatterers and fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of them don\\'t dare tell me the truth, and the other half can\\'t find it. There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but . . .   \"I understand,\" Ned said softly.   Robert looked at him. \"I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.\" He smiled. \"Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.\"   Ned dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could Robert have had for coming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms. He spoke with the king\\'s voice, commanded the king\\'s armies, drafted the king\\'s laws. At times he even sat upon the Iron Throne to dispense king\\'s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise indisposed. Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself.   It was the last thing in the world he wanted.   \"Your Grace,\" he said. \"I am not worthy of the honor.\"   Robert groaned with good-humored impatience. \"If I wanted to honor you, I\\'d let you retire. I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave.\" He slapped his gut and grinned. \"You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?\"   Ned knew the saying. \"What the king dreams,\" he said, \"the Hand builds.\"   \"I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it. The king eats, they say, and the Hand takes the shit.\" He threw back his head and roared his laughter. The echoes rang through the darkness, and all around them the dead of Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes.   Finally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised. \"Damn it, Ned,\" the king complained. \"You might at least humor me with a smile.\"   \"They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man\\'s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death,\" Ned said evenly. \"Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.\"   \"Come south with me, and I\\'ll teach you how to laugh again,\" the king promised. \"You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. We were meant to rule together. If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection. Well, it is not too late. I have a son. You have a daughter. My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as Lyanna and I might once have done.\"   This offer did surprise him. \"Sansa is only eleven.\"   Robert waved an impatient hand. \"Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a few years.\" The king smiled. \"Now stand up and say yes, curse you.\"   \"Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,\" Ned answered. He hesitated. \"These honors are all so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I need to tell my wife . . . \"   \"Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.\" The king reached down, clasped Ned by the hand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. \"Just don\\'t keep me waiting too long. I am not the most patient of men.\"   For a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. This was his place, here in the north. He looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. He could feel the eyes of the dead. They were all listening, he knew. And winter was coming. ',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 5.      There were times - not many, but a few - when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them.   He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips.   The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon\\'s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations.   It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon\\'s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that. Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for.   And he was finding that he had a man\\'s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king\\'s offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all.   His lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. Even at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile.   Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great disappointment to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups.   After them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. Close behind came Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided she was insipid. Robb didn\\'t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool.   His half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey Baratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon\\'s vast dismay. Prince Joffrey had his sister\\'s hair and his mother\\'s deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon did not like Joffrey\\'s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell\\'s Great Hall.   He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen\\'s brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered \"Kingslayer\" behind his back.   Jon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as the man passed.   Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother\\'s side. Tyrion Lannister, the youngest of Lord Tywin\\'s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, they had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his brother\\'s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. His head was too large for his body, with a brute\\'s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. Jon watched him with fascination.   The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night\\'s Watch, and his father\\'s ward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the feasting began.  Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped.   Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. \"Hungry again?\" he asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too.   His eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken.   Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. Jon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three times the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought better of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went back to his meal.   Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating.   \"Is this one of the direwolves I\\'ve heard so much of?\" a familiar voice asked close at hand.   Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf\\'s. \"Yes,\" he said. \"His name is Ghost.\"   One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he\\'d been telling to make room at the table for their lord\\'s brother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon\\'s hand. \"Summerwine,\" he said after a taste. \"Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?\"   Jon smiled.   Ben Stark laughed. \"As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk.\" He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it. It crunched.   His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night\\'s Watch. Tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped round his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. \"A very quiet wolf,\" he observed.   \"He\\'s not like the others,\" Jon said. \"He never makes a sound. That\\'s why I named him Ghost. That, and because he\\'s white. The others are all dark, grey or black.\"   \"There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.\" Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look. \"Don\\'t you usually eat at table with your brothers?\"   \"Most times,\" Jon answered in a flat voice. \"But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them.\"   \"I see.\" His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall . \"My brother does not seem very festive tonight.\"   Jon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes. His father was observing all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking heavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture. \"The queen is angry too,\" Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. \"Father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn\\'t want him to go.\"   Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. \"You don\\'t miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall.\"   Jon swelled with pride. \"Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I\\'m the better sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.\"   \"Notable achievements.\"   \"Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,\" Jon said in a sudden rush. \"Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will.\"   Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully. \"The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.\"   \"I am almost a man grown,\" Jon protested. \"I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children.\"   \"That\\'s true enough,\" Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon\\'s cup from the table, filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow.   \"Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\" Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes.   \"A conquest that lasted a summer,\" his uncle pointed out. \"Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn\\'t a game.\" He took another sip of wine. \"Also,\" he said, wiping his mouth, \"Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died. Or have you forgotten that part?\"   \"I forget nothing,\" Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make himself seem taller. \"I want to serve in the Night\\'s Watch, Uncle.\"   He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon would be Robb\\'s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn?   \"You don\\'t know what you\\'re asking, Jon. The Night\\'s Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor.\"   \"A bastard can have honor too,\" Jon said. \"I am ready to swear your oath.\"   \"You are a boy of fourteen,\" Benjen said. \"Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.\"   \"I don\\'t care about that!\" Jon said hotly.   \"You might, if you knew what it meant,\" Benjen said. \"If you knew what the oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.\"   Jon felt anger rise inside him. \"I\\'m not your son!\"   Benjen Stark stood up. \"More\\'s the pity.\" He put a hand on Jon\\'s shoulder. \"Come back to me after you\\'ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we\\'ll see how you feel.\"   Jon trembled. \"I will never father a bastard,\" he said carefully. \"Never!\" He spat it out like venom.   Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet.   \"I must be excused,\" he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see him cry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night.   The yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with him in an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him of that tonight.   The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were the last things Jon wanted to hear. He wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go.   \"Boy,\" a voice called out to him. Jon turned.   Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. \"Is that animal a wolf?\"   \"A direwolf,\" Jon said. \"His name is Ghost.\" He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly forgotten. \"What are you doing up there? Why aren\\'t you at the feast?\"   \"Too hot, too noisy, and I\\'d drunk too much wine,\" the dwarf told him. \"I learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?\"   Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. \"Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?\"   \"Oh, bleed that,\" the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs.   Ghost backed away from him uncertainly.   The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. \"I believe I\\'ve frightened your wolf. My apologies.\"   \"He\\'s not scared,\" Jon said. He knelt and called out. \"Ghost, come here. Come on. That\\'s it.\"   The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon\\'s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. \"Shy, isn\\'t he?\" Lannister observed.   \"Sit, Ghost,\" Jon commanded. \"That\\'s it. Keep still.\" He looked up at the dwarf. \"You can touch him now. He won\\'t move until I tell him to. I\\'ve been training him.\"   \"I see,\" Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost\\'s ears and said, \"Nice wolf.\"   \"If I wasn\\'t here, he\\'d tear out your throat,\" Jon said. It wasn\\'t actually true yet, but it would be.   \"In that case, you had best stay close,\" the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. \"I am Tyrion Lannister.\"   \"I know,\" Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange.   \"You\\'re Ned Stark\\'s bastard, aren\\'t you?\"   Jon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing.   \"Did I offend you?\" Lannister said. \"Sorry. Dwarfs don\\'t have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.\" He grinned. \"You are the bastard, though.\"   \"Lord Eddard Stark is my father,\" Jon admitted stiffly.   Lannister studied his face. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I can see it. You have more of the north in you than your brothers.\"   \"Half brothers,\" Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf\\'s comment, but he tried not to let it show.   \"Let me give you some counsel, bastard,\" Lannister said. \"Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.\"   Jon was in no mood for anyone\\'s counsel. \"What do you know about being a bastard?\"   \"All dwarfs are bastards in their father\\'s eyes.\"   \"You are your mother\\'s trueborn son of Lannister.\"   \"Am I?\" the dwarf replied, sardonic. \"Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing me, and he\\'s never been sure.\"   \"I don\\'t even know who my mother was,\" Jon said.   \"Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.\" He favored Jon with a rueful grin. \"Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.\" And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king. ',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 6.      Of all the rooms in Winterfell\\'s Great Keep, Catelyn\\'s bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man\\'s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.   Catelyn\\'s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place.   So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the chamber.   The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, na ed and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. She prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She could give him another son.   \"I will refuse him,\" Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt.   Catelyn sat up in the bed. \"You cannot. You must not.\"   \"My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert\\'s Hand.\"   \"He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you refuse to serve him, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can\\'t you see the danger that would put us in?\"   Ned shook his head, refusing to believe. \"Robert would never harm me or any of mine. We were closer than brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will laugh about it together. I know the man!\"  \"You knew the man,\" she said. \"The king is a stranger to you.\" Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. She had to make him see. \"Pride is everything to a king, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw them back in his face.\"   \"Honors?\" Ned laughed bitterly.   \"In his eyes, yes,\" she said.   \"And in yours?\"   \"And in mine,\" she blazed, angry now. Why couldn\\'t he see? \"He offers his own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with that?\"   \"Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,\" Ned said. \"And Joffrey . . . Joffrey is . . . \"   She finished for him. \" . . . crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon.\"   That brought a bitter twist to Ned\\'s mouth. \"Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King\\'s Hand and a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.\"   \"Perhaps not,\" Catelyn said, \"but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, like it or not.\"   Ned turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out in the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall.   Catelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon\\'s place, as custom decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son.   She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. Ned turned, frowning. \"What is it?\"   Desmond\\'s voice came through the door. \"My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent audience.\"   \"You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?\"   \"Yes, my lord. He insists.\"   \"Very well. Send him in.\"   Ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. \"Perhaps we should close the windows,\" she suggested.   Ned nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in.   The maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His hair was grey, what little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he kept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all.   The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. \"My lord,\" he said to Ned, \"pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a message.\"   Ned looked irritated. \"Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not told.\"   \"There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king\\'s party. We have had no other visitors from the south.\"   \"A wooden box, you say?\" Catelyn said.   \"Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.\"   Ned frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. \"A lens,\" he said. \"What has that to do with me?\"   \"I asked the same question,\" Maester Luwin said. \"Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.\"   Under the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. \"A lens is an instrument to help us see.\"   \"Indeed it is.\" He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe, each link forged from a different metal.   Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. \"What is it that they would have us see more clearly?\"   \"The very thing I asked myself.\" Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve. \"I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes.\"   Ned held out his hand. \"Let me have it, then.\"   Luwin did not stir. \"Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?\"   Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed. It was sealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and began to retreat.   \"Stay,\" Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. \"What is it? My lady, you\\'re shaking.\"   \"I\\'m afraid,\" she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. The furs dropped away from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn. \"It\\'s from Lysa.\" Catelyn looked at her husband. \"It will not make us glad,\" she told him. \"There is grief in this message, Ned. I can feel it.\"   Ned frowned, his face darkening. \"Open it.\"   Catelyn broke the seal.   Her eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. \"Lysa took no chances. When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and I.\"   \"Can you read it?\"   \"Yes,\" Catelyn admitted.   \"Then tell us.\"   \"Perhaps I should withdraw,\" Maester Luwin said.   \"No,\" Catelyn said. \"We will need your counsel.\" She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room.   Maester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. \"What are you doing?\" he asked.   \"Lighting a fire,\" Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the cold hearth.   \"Maester Luwin - \" Ned began.   \"Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,\" Catelyn said. \"This is no time for false modesty.\" She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it.   Ned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches from her. \"My lady, tell me! What was this message?\"   Catelyn stiffened in his grasp. \"A warning,\" she said softly. \"If we have the wits to hear.\"   His eyes searched her face. \"Go on.\"   \"Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.\"   His fingers tightened on her arm. \"By whom?\"   \"The Lannisters,\" she told him. \"The queen.\"   Ned released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. \"Gods,\" he whispered. His voice was hoarse. \"Your sister is sick with grief. She cannot know what she is saying.\"   \"She knows,\" Catelyn said. \"Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly hidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands . To risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion.\" Catelyn looked to her husband. \"Now we truly have no choice. You must be Robert\\'s Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.\"   She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. \"The only truths I know are here. The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.\"   Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. \"The Hand of the King has great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn\\'s death, to bring his killers to the king\\'s justice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.\"   Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn\\'s heart went out to him, but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her children\\'s sake. \"You say you love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?\"   \"The Others take both of you,\" Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from them and went to the window. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved. When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full of melancholy, and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes. \"My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. He never came home again.\"   \"A different time,\" Maester Luwin said. \"A different king.\"   \"Yes,\" Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. \"Catelyn, you shall stay here in Winterfell.\"   His words were like an icy draft through her heart. \"No,\" she said, suddenly afraid. Was this to be her punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her?   \"Yes,\" Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. \"You must govern the north in my stead, while I run Robert\\'s errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he will be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your councils. He must be ready when his time comes.\"   \"Gods will, not for many years,\" Maester Luwin murmured.   \"Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and small. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.\"   Maester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded. \"What of the other children?\"   Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \"Rickon is very young,\" he said gently. \"He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take with me.\"   \"I could not bear it,\" Catelyn said, trembling.   \"You must,\" he said. \"Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.\"   Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran. \"Yes,\" she said, \"but please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.\"   \"I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,\" Ned said. \"Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their friend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.\"   He was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would lose all four of them, then: Ned, and both girls, and her sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. Winterfell was such a vast place. \"Keep him off the walls, then,\" she said bravely. \"You know how Bran loves to climb.\"   Ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. \"Thank you, my lady,\" he whispered. \"This is hard, I know.\"   \"What of Jon Snow, my lord?\" Maester Luwin asked.   Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away.   Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man\\'s needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father\\'s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child\\'s needs.   He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and called him \"son\" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.   That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband\\'s soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys\\'s Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur\\'s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the SummerSea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.   That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. \"Never ask me about Jon,\" he said, cold as ice. \"He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.\" She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne\\'s name was never heard in Winterfell again.   Whoever Jon\\'s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned\\'s sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. \"Jon must go,\" she said now.   \"He and Robb are close,\" Ned said. \"I had hoped . . . \"   \"He cannot stay here,\" Catelyn said, cutting him off. \"He is your son, not mine. I will not have him.\" It was hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at Winterfell.   The look Ned gave her was anguished. \"You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for him at court. A boy with a bastard\\'s name . . . you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned.\"   Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband\\'s eyes. \"They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.\"    \"And none of them has ever been seen at court!\" Ned blazed. \"The Lannister woman has seen to that. How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He - \"   His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. \"Another solution presents itself,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It seems the boy aspires to take the black.\"   Ned looked shocked. \"He asked to join the Night\\'s Watch?\"   Catelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would take the oath as well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn\\'s own grandchildren for Winterfell.   Maester Luwin said, \"There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.\"   \"And even a bastard may rise high in the Night\\'s Watch,\" Ned reflected. Still, his voice was troubled. \"Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of fourteen . . . \"   \"A hard sacrifice,\" Maester Luwin agreed. \"Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is no crueler than yours or your lady\\'s.\"   Catelyn thought of the three children she must lose. It was not easy keeping silent then.   Ned turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and thoughtful. Finally he sighed, and turned back. \"Very well,\" he said to Maester Luwin. \"I suppose it is for the best. I will speak to Ben.\"   \"When shall we tell Jon?\" the maester asked.   \"When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart. I would sooner let Jon enjoy these last few days. Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. When the time comes, I will tell him myself.\" ',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 65.      The scent of hot bread drifting from the shops along the Street of Flour was sweeter than any perfume Arya had ever smelled. She took a deep breath and stepped closer to the pigeon. It was a plump one, speckled brown, busily pecking at a crust that had fallen between two cobblestones, but when Arya\\'s shadow touched it, it took to the air.   Her stick sword whistled out and caught it two feet off the ground, and it went down in a flurry of brown feathers. She was on it in the blink of an eye, grabbing a wing as the pigeon flapped and fluttered. It pecked at her hand. She grabbed its neck and twisted until she felt the bone snap.   Compared with catching cats, pigeons were easy.   A passing septon was looking at her askance. \"Here\\'s the best place to find pigeon,\" Arya told him as she brushed herself off and picked up her fallen stick sword. \"They come for the crumbs.\" He hurried away.   She tied the pigeon to her belt and started down the street. A man was pushing a load of tarts by on a two-wheeled cart; the smells sang of blueberries and lemons and apricots. Her stomach made a hollow rumbly noise. \"Could I have one?\" she heard herself say. \"A lemon, or . . . or any kind.\"   The pushcart man looked her up and down. Plainly he did not like what he saw. \"Three coppers.\"   Arya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot. \"I\\'ll trade you a fat pigeon,\" she said.   \"The Others take your pigeon,\" the pushcart man said.   The tarts were still warm from the oven. The smells were making her mouth water, but she did not have three coppers . . . or one. She gave the pushcart man a look, remembering what Syrio had told her about seeing. He was short, with a little round belly, and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little. She was just thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when he said, \"You be keepin\\' your filthy hands off. The gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving little gutter rats, that they do.\"  Arya glanced warily behind her. Two of the City Watch were standing at the mouth of an alley. Their cloaks hung almost to the ground, the heavy wool dyed a rich gold; their mail and boots and gloves were black. One wore a longsword at his hip, the other an iron cudgel. With a last wistful glance at the tarts, Arya edged back from the cart and hurried off. The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special attention, but the sight of them tied her stomach in knots. Arya had been staying as far from the castle as she could get, yet even from a distance she could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls. Flocks of crows squabbled noisily over each head, thick as flies. The talk in Flea Bottom was that the gold cloaks had thrown in with the Lannisters, their commander raised to a lord, with lands on the Trident and a seat on the king\\'s council.   She had also heard other things, scary things, things that made no sense to her. Some said her father had murdered King Robert and been slain in turn by Lord Renly. Others insisted that Renly had killed the king in a drunken quarrel between brothers. Why else should he have fled in the night like a common thief? One story said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting, another that he\\'d died eating a boar, stuffing himself so full that he\\'d ruptured at the table. No, the king had died at table, others said, but only because Varys the Spider poisoned him. No, it had been the queen who poisoned him. No, he had died of a pox. No, he had choked on a fish bone.   One thing all the stories agreed on: King Robert was dead. The bells in the seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night, the thunder of their grief rolling across the city in a bronze tide. They only rang the bells like that for the death of a king, a tanner\\'s boy told Arya.   All she wanted was to go home, but leaving King\\'s Landing was not so easy as she had hoped. Talk of war was on every lip, and gold cloaks were as thick on the city walls as fleas on . . . well, her, for one. She had been sleeping in Flea Bottom, on rooftops and in stables, wherever she could find a place to lie down, and it hadn\\'t taken her long to learn that the district was well named.   Every day since her escape from the Red Keep, Arya had visited each of the seven city gates in turn. The Dragon Gate, the Lion Gate, and the Old Gate were closed and barred. The Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open, but only to those who wanted to enter the city; the guards let no one out. Those who were allowed to leave left by the King\\'s Gate or the Iron Gate, but Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms manned the guard posts there. Spying down from the roof of an inn by the King\\'s Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages, forcing riders to open their saddlebags, and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot.   Sometimes she thought about swimming the river, but the Blackwater Rush was wide and deep, and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous. She had no coin to pay a ferryman or take passage on a ship.   Her lord father had taught her never to steal, but it was growing harder to remember why. If she did not get out soon, she would have to take her chances with the gold cloaks. She hadn\\'t gone hungry much since she learned to knock down birds with her stick sword, but she feared so much pigeon was making her sick. A couple she\\'d eaten raw, before she found Flea Bottom.   In the Bottom there were pot-shops along the alleys where huge tubs of stew had been simmering for years, and you could trade half your bird for a heel of yesterday\\'s bread and a \"bowl o\\' brown,\" and they\\'d even stick the other half in the fire and crisp it up for you, so long as you plucked the feathers yourself. Arya would have given anything for a cup of milk and a lemon cake, but the brown wasn\\'t so bad. It usually had barley in it, and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip, and sometimes even apple, with a film of grease swimming on top. Mostly she tried not to think about the meat. Once she had gotten a piece of fish.   The only thing was, the pot-shops were never empty, and even as she bolted down her food, Arya could feel them watching. Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak, and she knew what they were thinking. With others, she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers; she didn\\'t know what they were thinking, and that scared her even more. A couple times, she was followed out into the alleys and chased, but so far no one had been able to catch her.   The silver bracelet she\\'d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle, along with her bundle of good clothes, snatched while she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley. All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in, the leathers on her back, her wooden practice sword . . . and Needle. She\\'d been lying on top of Needle, or else it would have been gone too; it was worth more than all the rest together. Since then Arya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm, to conceal the blade at her hip. The wooden sword she carried in her left hand, out where everybody could see it, to scare off robbers, but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn\\'t have been scared off if she\\'d had a battle-axe. It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread. Often as not, she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares.   Once she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries. Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south. And she could dig for roots in the forest, even run down some rabbits. In the city, the only things to run down were rats and cats and scrawny dogs. The potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups, she\\'d heard, but she didn\\'t like to think about that.   Down below the Street of Flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross streets. Arya scrambled through the crowds, trying to put distance between her and the gold cloaks. She had learned to keep to the center of the street. Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses, but at least you could see them coming. If you walked near the buildings, people grabbed you. In some alleys you couldn\\'t help but brush against the walls; the buildings leaned in so close they almost met.   A whooping gang of small children went running past, chasing a rolling hoop. Arya stared at them with resentment, remembering the times she\\'d played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother Rickon. She wondered how big Rickon had grown, and whether Bran was sad. She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her \"little sister\" and muss her hair. Not that it needed mussing. She\\'d seen her reflection in puddles, and she didn\\'t think hair got any more mussed than hers.   She had tried talking to the children she saw in the street, hoping to make a friend who would give her a place to sleep, but she must have talked wrong or something. The little ones only looked at her with quick, wary eyes and ran away if she came too close. Their big brothers and sisters asked questions Arya couldn\\'t answer, called her names, and tried to steal from her. Only yesterday, a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet, but Arya gave her a crack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding.   A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya glanced at it thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her stick. It made her think of the sea. Maybe that was the way out. Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures. Maybe Arya could do that too. She decided to visit the riverfront. It was on the way to the Mud Gate anyway, and she hadn\\'t checked that one today.   The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. She spied another pair of gold cloaks, walking side by side through the fish market, but they never so much as looked at her. Half the stalls were empty, and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered. Out on the Blackwater, three of the king\\'s war galleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell. Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make her way along the river.   When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin, her heart almost stopped in her chest. The sight of Winterfell\\'s colors brought tears to her eyes. Behind them, a sleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her moorings. Arya could not read the name painted on the hull; the words were strange, Myrish, Braavosi, perhaps even High Valyrian. She grabbed a passing longshoreman by the sleeve. \"Please,\" she said, \"what ship is this?\"   \"She\\'s the Wind Witch, out of Myr,\" the man said.   \"She\\'s still here,\" Arya blurted. The longshoreman gave her a queer look, shrugged, and walked away. Arya ran toward the pier. The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take her home . . . still waiting! She\\'d imagined it had sailed ages ago.   Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds, his hand on the pommel of his sword. Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby, she stopped to rub at her eyes. Her eyes her eyes her eyes, why did . . .   Look with your eyes, she heard Syrio whisper.   Arya looked. She knew all of her father\\'s men. The three in the grey cloaks were strangers. \"You,\" the one walking rounds called out. \"What do you want here, boy?\" The other two looked up from their dice.   It was all Arya could do not to bolt and run, but she knew that if she did, they would be after her at once. She made herself walk closer. They were looking for a girl, but he thought she was a boy. She\\'d be a boy, then. \"Want to buy a pigeon?\" She showed him the dead bird.   \"Get out of here,\" the guardsman said.   Arya did as he told her. She did not have to pretend to be frightened. Behind her, the men went back to their dice.   She could not have said how she got back to Flea Bottom, but she was breathing hard by the time she reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills. The Bottom had a stench to it, a stink of pigsties and stables and tanner\\'s sheds, mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap whorehouses. Arya wound her way through the maze dully. It was not until she caught a whiff of bubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized her pigeon was gone. It must have slipped from her belt as she ran, or someone had stolen it and she\\'d never noticed. For a moment she wanted to cry again. She\\'d have to walk all the way back to the Street of Flour to find another one that plump.   Far across the city, bells began to ring.   Arya glanced up, listening, wondering what the ringing meant this time.   \"What\\'s this now?\" a fat man called from the pot-shop.   \"The bells again, gods ha\\'mercy,\" wailed an old woman.   A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story window. \"Is it the boy king that\\'s died now?\" she shouted down, leaning out over the street. \"Ah, that\\'s a boy for you, they never last long .\" As she laughed, a na ed man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white br  sts that hung loose beneath her shift.   \"Stupid slut,\" the fat man shouted up. \"The king\\'s not dead, that\\'s only summoning bells. One tower tolling. When the king dies, they ring every bell in the city.\"   \"Here, quit your biting, or I\\'ll ring your bells,\" the woman in the window said to the man behind her, pushing him off with an elbow. \"So who is it died, if not the king?\"   \"It\\'s a summoning,\" the fat man repeated.   Two boys close to Arya\\'s age scampered past, splashing through a puddle. The old woman cursed them, but they kept right on going. Other people were moving too, heading up the hill to see what the noise was about. Arya ran after the slower boy. \"Where you going?\" she shouted when she was right behind him. \"What\\'s happening?\"   He glanced back without slowing. \"The gold cloaks is carryin\\' him to the sept.\"   \"Who?\" she yelled, running hard.   \"The Hand! They\\'ll be taking his head off, Buu says.\"   A passing wagon had left a deep rut in the street. The boy leapt over, but Arya never saw it. She tripped and fell, face first, scraping her knee open on a stone and smashing her fingers when her hands hit the hard-packed earth. Needle tangled between her legs. She sobbed as she struggled to her knees. The thumb of her left hand was covered with blood. When she sucked on it, she saw that half the thumbnail was gone, ripped off in her fall. Her hands throbbed, and her knee was all bloody too.   \"Make way!\" someone shouted from the cross street. \"Make way for my lords of Redwyne!\" It was all Arya could do to get out of the road before they ran her down, four guardsmen on huge horses, pounding past at a gallop. They wore checked cloaks, blue-and-burgundy. Behind them, two young lordlings rode side by side on a pair of chestnut mares alike as peas in a pod. Arya had seen them in the bailey a hundred times; the Redwyne twins, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, homely youths with orange hair and square, freckled faces. Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber, and giggle whenever they caught sight of them. They did not look funny now.   Everyone was moving in the same direction, all in a hurry to see what the ringing was all about. The bells seemed louder now, clanging, calling. Arya joined the stream of people. Her thumb hurt so bad where the nail had broken that it was all she could do not to cry. She bit her lip as she limped along, listening to the excited voices around her.   \" - the King\\'s Hand, Lord Stark. They\\'re carrying him up to Baelor\\'s Sept.\"   \"I heard he was dead.\"   \"Soon enough, soon enough. Here, I got me a silver stag says they lop his head off.\"   \"Past time, the traitor.\" The man spat.   Arya struggled to find a voice. \"He never - \" she started, but she was only a child and they talked right over her.   \"Fool! They ain\\'t neither going to lop him. Since when do they knick traitors on the steps of the Great Sept?\"   \"Well, they don\\'t mean to anoint him no knight. I heard it was Stark killed old King Robert. Slit his throat in the woods, and when they found him, he stood there cool as you please and said it was some old boar did for His Grace.\"   \"Ah, that\\'s not true, it was his own brother did him, that Renly, him with his gold antlers.\"   \"You shut your lying mouth, woman. You don\\'t know what you\\'re saying, his lordship\\'s a fine true man.\"   By the time they reached the Street of the Sisters, they were packed in shoulder to shoulder. Arya let the human current carry her along, up to the top of Visenya\\'s Hill. The white marble plaza was a solid mass of people, all yammering excitedly at each other and straining to get closer to the Great Sept of Baelor. The bells were very loud here.   Arya squirmed through the press, ducking between the legs of horses and clutching tight to her sword stick. From the middle of the crowd, all she could see were arms and legs and stomachs, and the seven slender towers of the sept looming overhead. She spotted a wood wagon and thought to climb up on the back where she might be able to see, but others had the same idea. The teamster cursed at them and drove them off with a crack of his whip.  Arya grew frantic. Forcing her way to the front of the crowd, she was shoved up against the stone of a plinth. She looked up at Baelor the Blessed, the septon king. Sliding her stick sword through her belt, Arya began to climb. Her broken thumbnail left smears of blood on the painted marble, but she made it up, and wedged herself in between the king\\'s feet.   That was when she saw her father.   Lord Eddard stood on the High Septon\\'s pulpit outside the doors of the sept, supported between two of the gold cloaks. He was dressed in a rich grey velvet doublet with a white wolf sewn on the front in beads, and a grey wool cloak trimmed with fur, but he was thinner than Arya had ever seen him, his long face drawn with pain. He was not standing so much as being held up; the cast over his broken leg was grey and rotten.   The High Septon himself stood behind him, a squat man, grey with age and ponderously fat, wearing long white robes and an immense crown of spun gold and crystal that wreathed his head with rainbows whenever he moved.   Clustered around the doors of the sept, in front of the raised marble pulpit, were a knot of knights and high lords. Joffrey was prominent among them, his raiment all crimson, silk and satin patterned with prancing stags and roaring lions, a gold crown on his head. His queen mother stood beside him in a black mourning gown slashed with crimson, a veil of black diamonds in her hair. Arya recognized the Hound, wearing a snowy white cloak over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him. She saw Varys the eunuch gliding among the lords in soft slippers and a patterned damask robe, and she thought the short man with the silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for Mother.   And there in their midst was Sansa, dressed in sky-blue silk, with her long auburn hair washed and curled and silver bracelets on her wrists. Arya scowled, wondering what her sister was doing here, why she looked so happy.   A long line of gold-cloaked spearmen held back the crowd, commanded by a stout man in elaborate armor, all black lacquer and gold filigree. His cloak had the metallic shimmer of true cloth-of-gold.   When the bell ceased to toll, a quiet slowly settled across the great plaza, and her father lifted his head and began to speak, his voice so thin and weak she could scarcely make him out. People behind her began to shout out, \"What?\" and \"Louder!\" The man in the black-and-gold armor stepped up behind Father and prodded him sharply. You leave him alone! Arya wanted to shout, but she knew no one would listen. She chewed her lip.   Her father raised his voice and began again. \"I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King,\" he said more loudly, his voice carrying across the plaza, \"and I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of gods and men.\"   \"No,\" Arya whimpered. Below her, the crowd began to scream and shout. Taunts and obscenities filled the air. Sansa had hidden her face in her hands.   Her father raised his voice still higher, straining to be heard. \"I betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my friend, Robert,\" he shouted. \"I swore to defend and protect his children, yet before his blood was cold, I plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Beloved and the Seven bear witness to the truth of what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, and by the grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.\"   A stone came sailing out of the crowd. Arya cried out as she saw her father hit. The gold cloaks kept him from falling. Blood ran down his face from a deep gash across his forehead. More stones followed. One struck the guard to Father\\'s left. Another went clanging off the breastplate of the knight in the black-and-gold armor. Two of the Kingsguard stepped in front of Joffrey and the queen, protecting them with their shields.   Her hand slid beneath her cloak and found Needle in its sheath. She tightened her fingers around the grip, squeezing as hard as she had ever squeezed anything. Please, gods, keep him safe, she prayed. Don\\'t let them hurt my father.   The High Septon knelt before Joffrey and his mother. \"As we sin, so do we suffer,\" he intoned, in a deep swelling voice much louder than Father\\'s. \"This man has confessed his crimes in the sight of gods and men, here in this holy place.\" Rainbows danced around his head as he lifted his hands in entreaty. \"The gods are just, yet Blessed Baelor taught us that they are also merciful. What shall be done with this traitor, Your Grace?\"   A thousand voices were screaming, but Arya never heard them. Prince Joffrey . . . no, King Joffrey . . . stepped out from behind the shields of his Kingsguard. \"My mother bids me let Lord Eddard take the black, and Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father.\" He looked straight at Sansa then, and smiled, and for a moment Arya thought that the gods had heard her prayer, until Joffrey turned back to the crowd and said, \"But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your king, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!\"   The crowd roared, and Arya felt the statue of Baelor rock as they surged against it. The High Septon clutched at the king\\'s cape, and Varys came rushing over waving his arms, and even the queen was saying something to him, but Joffrey shook his head. Lords and knights moved aside as he stepped through, tall and fleshless, a skeleton in iron mail, the King\\'s Justice. Dimly, as if from far off, Arya heard her sister scream. Sansa had fallen to her knees, sobbing hysterically. Ser Ilyn Payne climbed the steps of the pulpit.   Arya wriggled between Baelor\\'s feet and threw herself into the crowd, drawing Needle. She landed on a man in a butcher\\'s apron, knocking him to the ground. Immediately someone slammed into her back and she almost went down herself. Bodies closed in around her, stumbling and pushing, trampling on the poor butcher. Arya slashed at them with Needle.   High atop the pulpit, Ser Ilyn Payne gestured and the knight in black-and-gold gave a command. The gold cloaks flung Lord Eddard to the marble, with his head and chest out over the edge.   \"Here, you!\" an angry voice shouted at Arya, but she bowled past, shoving people aside, squirming between them, slamming into anyone in her way. A hand fumbled at her leg and she hacked at it, kicked at shins. A woman stumbled and Arya ran up her back, cutting to both sides, but it was no good, no good, there were too many people, no sooner did she make a hole than it closed again. Someone buffeted her aside. She could still hear Sansa screaming.   Ser Ilyn drew a two-handed greatsword from the scabbard on his back. As he lifted the blade above his head, sunlight seemed to ripple and dance down the dark metal, glinting off an edge sharper than any razor. Ice, she thought, he has Ice! Her tears streamed down her face, blinding her.   And then a hand shot out of the press and closed round her arm like a wolf trap, so hard that Needle went flying from her hand. Arya was wrenched off her feet. She would have fallen if he hadn\\'t held her up, as easy as if she were a doll. A face pressed close to hers, long black hair and tangled beard and rotten teeth. \"Don\\'t look!\" a thick voice snarled at her.   \"I . . . I . . . I . . . \" Arya sobbed.   The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. \"Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy.\" Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a . . . a noise . . . a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their breath at once. The old man\\'s fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron. \"Look at me. Yes, that\\'s the way of it, at me.\" Sour wine perfumed his breath. \"Remember, boy?\"   It was the smell that did it. Arya saw the matted greasy hair, the patched, dusty black cloak that covered his twisted shoulders, the hard black eyes squinting at her. And she remembered the black brother who had come to visit her father.   \"Know me now, do you? There\\'s a bright boy.\" He spat. \"They\\'re done here. You\\'ll be coming with me, and you\\'ll be keeping your mouth shut.\" When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. \"Shut, I said.\"   The plaza was beginning to empty. The press dissolved around them as people drifted back to their lives. But Arya\\'s life was gone. Numb, she trailed along beside . . . Yoren, yes, his name is Yoren. She did not recall him finding Needle, until he handed the sword back to her. \"Hope you can use that, boy.\"   \"I\\'m not - \" she started.   He shoved her into a doorway, thrust dirty fingers through her hair, and gave it a twist, yanking her head back. \" - not a smart boy, that what you mean to say?\"   He had a knife in his other hand.   As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kicking wildly, wrenching her head from side to side, but he had her by the hair, so strong, she could feel her scalp tearing, and on her lips the salt taste of tears. ',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 66.      The oldest were men grown, seventeen and eighteen years from the day of their naming. One was past twenty. Most were younger, sixteen or less.   Bran watched them from the balcony of Maester Luwin\\'s turret, listening to them grunt and strain and curse as they swung their staves and wooden swords. The yard was alive to the clack of wood on wood, punctuated all too often by thwacks and yowls of pain when a blow struck leather or flesh. Ser Rodrik strode among the boys, face reddening beneath his white whiskers, muttering at them one and all. Bran had never seen the old knight look so fierce. \"No,\" he kept saying. \"No. No. No.\"   \"They don\\'t fight very well,\" Bran said dubiously. He scratched Summer idly behind the ears as the direwolf tore at a haunch of meat. Bones crunched between his teeth.   \"For a certainty,\" Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky. \"Yet given time . . . Ser Rodrik has the truth of it, we need men to walk the walls. Your lord father took the cream of his guard to King\\'s Landing, and your brother took the rest, along with all the likely lads for leagues around. Many will not come back to us, and we must needs find the men to take their places.\"   Bran stared resentfully at the sweating boys below. \"If I still had my legs, I could beat them all.\" He remembered the last time he\\'d held a sword in his hand, when the king had come to Winterfell. It was only a wooden sword, yet he\\'d knocked Prince Tommen down half a hundred times. \"Ser Rodrik should teach me to use a poleaxe. If I had a poleaxe with a big long haft, Hodor could be my legs. We could be a knight together.\"   \"I think that . . . unlikely,\" Maester Luwin said. \"Bran, when a man fights, his arms and legs and thoughts must be as one.\"   Below in the yard, Ser Rodrik was yelling. \"You fight like a goose. He pecks you and you peck him harder. Parry! Block the blow. Goose fighting will not suffice. If those were real swords, the first peck would take your arm off!\" One of the other boys laughed, and the old knight rounded on him. \"You laugh. You. Now that is gall. You fight like a hedgehog . . . \"   \"There was a knight once who couldn\\'t see,\" Bran said stubbornly, as Ser Rodrik went on below. \"Old Nan told me about him. He had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once.\"   \"Symeon Star-Eyes,\" Luwin said as he marked numbers in a book. \"When he lost his eyes, he put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim. Bran, that is only a story, like the tales of Florian the Fool. A fable from the Age of Heroes.\" The maester tsked. \"You must put these dreams aside, they will only break your heart.\"   The mention of dreams reminded him. \"I dreamed about the crow again last night. The one with three eyes. He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with him, so I did. We went down to the crypts. Father was there, and we talked. He was sad.\"   \"And why was that?\" Luwin peered through his tube.   \"It was something to do about Jon, I think.\" The dream had been deeply disturbing, more so than any of the other crow dreams. \"Hodor won\\'t go down into the crypts.\"   The maester had only been half listening, Bran could tell. He lifted his eye from the tube, blinking. \"Hodor won\\'t . . . \"   \"Go down into the crypts. When I woke, I told him to take me down, to see if Father was truly there. At first he didn\\'t know what I was saying, but I got him to the steps by telling him to go here and go there, only then he wouldn\\'t go down. He just stood on the top step and said \\'Hodor,\\' like he was scared of the dark, but I had a torch. It made me so mad I almost gave him a swat in the head, like Old Nan is always doing.\" He saw the way the maester was frowning and hurriedly added, \"I didn\\'t, though.\"   \"Good. Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten.\"   \"In the dream I flew down with the crow, but I can\\'t do that when I\\'m awake,\" Bran explained.   \"Why would you want to go down to the crypts?\"   \"I told you. To look for Father.\"   The maester tugged at the chain around his neck, as he often did when he was uncomfortable. \"Bran, sweet child, one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone, beside his father and his father\\'s father and all the Starks back to the old Kings in the North . . . but that will not be for many years, gods be good. Your father is a prisoner of the queen in King\\'s Landing. You will not find him in the crypts.\"   \"He was there last night. I talked to him.\"   \"Stubborn boy,\" the maester sighed, setting his book aside. \"Would you like to go see?\"   \"I can\\'t. Hodor won\\'t go, and the steps are too narrow and twisty for Dancer.\"   \"I believe I can solve that difficulty.\"   In place of Hodor, the wildling woman Osha was summoned. She was tall and tough and uncomplaining, willing to go wherever she was commanded. \"I lived my life beyond the Wall, a hole in the ground won\\'t fret me none, m\\'lords,\" she said.   \"Summer, come,\" Bran called as she lifted him in wiry-strong arms. The direwolf left his bone and followed as Osha carried Bran across the yard and down the spiral steps to the cold vault under the earth. Maester Luwin went ahead with a torch. Bran did not even mind - too badly - that she carried him in her arms and not on her back. Ser Rodrik had ordered Osha\\'s chain struck off, since she had served faithfully and well since she had been at Winterfell. She still wore the heavy iron shackles around her ankles - a sign that she was not yet wholly trusted - but they did not hinder her sure strides down the steps.   Bran could not recall the last time he had been in the crypts. It had been before, for certain. When he was little, he used to play down here with Robb and Jon and his sisters.   He wished they were here now; the vault might not have seemed so dark and scary. Summer stalked out in the echoing gloom, then stopped, lifted his head, and sniffed the chill dead air. He bared his teeth and crept backward, eyes glowing golden in the light of the maester\\'s torch. Even Osha, hard as old iron, seemed uncomfortable. \"Grim folk, by the look of them,\" she said as she eyed the long row of granite Starks on their stone thrones.  \"They were the Kings of Winter,\" Bran whispered. Somehow it felt wrong to talk too loudly in this place.   Osha smiled. \"Winter\\'s got no king. If you\\'d seen it, you\\'d know that, summer boy.\"   \"They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years,\" Maester Luwin said, lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces. Some were hairy and bearded, shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by their feet. Others were shaved clean, their features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron longswords across their laps. \"Hard men for a hard time. Come.\" He strode briskly down the vault, past the procession of stone pillars and the endless carved figures. A tongue of flame trailed back from the upraised torch as he went.   The vault was cavernous, longer than Winterfell itself, and Jon had told him once that there were other levels underneath, vaults even deeper and darker where the older kings were buried. It would not do to lose the light. Summer refused to move from the steps, even when Osha followed the torch, Bran in her arms.   \"Do you recall your history, Bran?\" the maester said as they walked. \"Tell Osha who they were and what they did, if you can.\"   He looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him. The maester had told him the stories, and Old Nan had made them come alive. \"That one is Jon Stark. When the sea raiders landed in the east, he drove them out and built the castle at White Harbor. His son was Rickard Stark, not my father\\'s father but another Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter. Theon Stark\\'s the real thin one with the long hair and the skinny beard. They called him the \\'Hungry Wolf,\\' because he was always at war. That\\'s a Brandon, the tall one with the dreamy face, he was Brandon the Shipwright, because he loved the sea. His tomb is empty. He tried to sail west across the Sunset Sea and was never seen again. His son was Brandon the Burner, because he put the torch to all his father\\'s ships in grief. There\\'s Rodrik Stark, who won Bear Island in a wrestling match and gave it to the Mormonts. And that\\'s Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knelt. He was the last King in the North and the first Lord of Winterfell, after he yielded to Aegon the Conqueror. Oh, there, he\\'s Cregan Stark. He fought with Prince Aemon once, and the Dragonknight said he\\'d never faced a finer swordsman.\" They were almost at the end now, and Bran felt a sadness creeping over him. \"And there\\'s my grandfather, Lord Rickard, who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys. His daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside him. Not me, another Brandon, my father\\'s brother. They\\'re not supposed to have statues, that\\'s only for the lords and the kings, but my father loved them so much he had them done.\"   \"The maid\\'s a fair one,\" Osha said.   \"Robert was betrothed to marry her, but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her,\" Bran explained. \"Robert fought a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer, but Lyanna died and he never got her back at all.\"   \"A sad tale,\" said Osha, \"but those empty holes are sadder.\"   \"Lord Eddard\\'s tomb, for when his time comes,\" Maester Luwin said. \"Is this where you saw your father in your dream, Bran?\"   \"Yes.\" The memory made him shiver. He looked around the vault uneasily, the hairs on the back of his neck bristling. Had he heard a noise? Was there someone here?   Maester Luwin stepped toward the open sepulchre, torch in hand. \"As you see, he\\'s not here. Nor will he be, for many a year. Dreams are only dreams, child.\" He thrust his arm into the blackness inside the tomb, as into the mouth of some great beast. \"Do you see? It\\'s quite empt - \"   The darkness sprang at him, snarling.   Bran saw eyes like green fire, a flash of teeth, fur as black as the pit around them. Maester Luwin yelled and threw up his hands. The torch went flying from his fingers, caromed off the stone face of Brandon Stark, and tumbled to the statue\\'s feet, the flames licking up his legs. In the drunken shifting torchlight, they saw Luwin struggling with the direwolf, beating at his muzzle with one hand while the jaws closed on the other.   \"Summer!\" Bran screamed.   And Summer came, shooting from the dimness behind them, a leaping shadow. He slammed into Shaggydog and knocked him back, and the two direwolves rolled over and over in a tangle of grey and black fur, snapping and biting at each other, while Maester Luwin struggled to his knees, his arm torn and bloody. Osha propped Bran up against Lord Rickard\\'s stone wolf as she hurried to assist the maester. In the light of the guttering torch, shadow wolves twenty feet tall fought on the wall and roof.   \"Shaggy,\" a small voice called. When Bran looked up, his little brother was standing in the mouth of Father\\'s tomb. With one final snap at Summer\\'s face, Shaggydog broke off and bounded to Rickon\\'s side. \"You let my father be,\" Rickon warned Luwin. \"You let him be.\"   \"Rickon,\" Bran said softly. \"Father\\'s not here.\"   \"Yes he is. I saw him.\" Tears glistened on Rickon\\'s face. \"I saw him last night.\"   \"In your dream . . . ?\"   Rickon nodded. \"You leave him. You leave him be. He\\'s coming home now, like he promised. He\\'s coming home.\"   Bran had never seen Maester Luwin took so uncertain before . Blood dripped down his arm where Shaggydog had shredded the wool of his sleeve and the flesh beneath. \"Osha, the torch,\" he said, biting through his pain, and she snatched it up before it went out. Soot stains blackened both legs of his uncle\\'s likeness. \"That . . . that beast,\" Luwin went on, \"is supposed to be chained up in the kennels.\"   Rickon patted Shaggydog\\'s muzzle, damp with blood. \"I let him loose. He doesn\\'t like chains.\" He licked at his fingers.   \"Rickon,\" Bran said, \"would you like to come with me?\"   \"No. I like it here.\"   \"It\\'s dark here. And cold.\"   \"I\\'m not afraid. I have to wait for Father.\"   \"You can wait with me,\" Bran said. \"We\\'ll wait together, you and me and our wolves.\" Both of the direwolves were licking wounds now, and would bear close watching.   \"Bran,\" the maester said firmly, \"I know you mean well, but Shaggydog is too wild to run loose. I\\'m the third man he\\'s savaged. Give him the freedom of the castle and it\\'s only a question of time before he kills someone. The truth is hard, but the wolf has to be chained, or . . . &amp;rdquo He hesitated   . . . or killed, Bran thought, but what he said was, \"He was not made for chains. We will wait in your tower, all of us.\"   \"That is quite impossible,\" Maester Luwin said.   Osha grinned. \"The boy\\'s the lordling here, as I recall.\" She handed Luwin back his torch and scooped Bran up into her arms again. \"The maester\\'s tower it is.\"   \"Will you come, Rickon?\"   His brother nodded. \"If Shaggy comes too,\" he said, running after Osha and Bran, and there was nothing Maester Luwin could do but follow, keeping a wary eye on the wolves.   Maester Luwin\\'s turret was so cluttered that it seemed to Bran a wonder that he ever found anything. Tottering piles of books covered tables and chairs, rows of stoppered jars lined the shelves, candle stubs and puddles of dried wax dotted the furniture, the bronze Myrish lens tube sat on a tripod by the terrace door, star charts hung from the walls, shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes, papers, quills, and pots of inks were everywhere, and all of it was spotted with droppings from the ravens in the rafters. Their strident quorks drifted down from above as Osha washed and cleaned and bandaged the maester\\'s wounds, under Luwin\\'s terse instruction. \"This is folly,\" the small grey man said while she dabbed at the wolf bites with a stinging ointment. \"I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream, yet when you stop to consider it, it\\'s only natural. You miss your lord father, and you know that he is a captive. Fear can fever a man\\'s mind and give him queer thoughts. Rickon is too young to comprehend - \"   \"I\\'m four now,\" Rickon said. He was peeking through the lens tube at the gargoyles on the First Keep. The direwolves sat on opposite sides of the large round room, licking their wounds and gnawing on bones.   \" - too young, and - ooh, seven hells, that burns, no, don\\'t stop, more. Too young, as I say, but you, Bran, you\\'re old enough to know that dreams are only dreams.\"   \"Some are, some aren\\'t.\" Osha poured pale red firemilk into a long gash. Luwin gasped. \"The children of the forest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming.\"   Tears were streaming down the maester\\'s face, yet he shook his head doggedly. \"The children . . . live only in dreams. Now. Dead and gone. Enough, that\\'s enough. Now the bandages. Pads and then wrap, and make it tight, I\\'ll be bleeding.\"   \"Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees, that they could fly like birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals,\" Bran said. \"She says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it.\"   \"And all this they did with magic,\" Maester Luwin said, distracted. \"I wish they were here now. A spell would heal my arm less painfully, and they could talk to Shaggydog and tell him not to bite.\" He gave the big black wolf an angry glance out of the corner of his eye. \"Take a lesson, Bran. The man who trusts in spells is dueling with a glass sword. As the children did. Here, let me show you something.\" He stood abruptly, crossed the room, and returned with a green jar in his good hand. \"Have a look at these,\" he said as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of shiny black arrowheads.   Bran picked one up. \"It\\'s made of glass.\" Curious, Rickon drifted closer to peer over the table.   \"Dragonglass,\" Osha named it as she sat down beside Luwin, bandagings in hand.   \"Obsidian,\" Maester Luwin insisted, holding out his wounded arm. \"Forged in the fires of the gods, far below the earth. The children of the forest hunted with that, thousands of years ago. The children worked no metal. In place of mail, they wore long shirts of woven leaves and bound their legs in bark, so they seemed to melt into the wood. In place of swords, they carried blades of obsidian.\"   \"And still do.\" Osha placed soft pads over the bites on the maester\\'s forearm and bound them tight with long strips of linen.   Bran held the arrowhead up close. The black glass was slick and shiny. He thought it beautiful. \"Can I keep one?\"   \"As you wish,\" the maester said.   \"I want one too,\" Rickon said. \"I want four. I\\'m four.\"   Luwin made him count them out. \"Careful, they\\'re still sharp. Don\\'t cut yourself.\"   \"Tell me about the children,\" Bran said. It was important.   \"What do you wish to know?\"   \"Everything.\"   Maester Luwin tugged at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. \"They were people of the Dawn Age, the very first, before kings and kingdoms,\" he said. \"In those days, there were no castles or holdfasts, no cities, not so much as a market town to be found between here and the sea of Dorne. There were no men at all. Only the children of the forest dwelt in the lands we now call the Seven Kingdoms.   \"They were a people dark and beautiful, small of stature, no taller than children even when grown to manhood. They lived in the depths of the wood, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Slight as they were, the children were quick and graceful. Male and female hunted together, with weirwood bows and flying snares. Their gods were the gods of the forest, stream, and stone, the old gods whose names are secret. Their wise men were called greenseers, and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods. How long the children reigned here or where they came from, no man can know.   \"But some twelve thousand years ago, the First Men appeared from the east, crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken. They came with bronze swords and great leathern shields, riding horses. No horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea. No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the faces in the trees. As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms, they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire. Horror-struck, the children went to war. The old songs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, shattering the Arm, but it was too late to close the door. The wars went on until the earth ran red with blood of men and children both, but more children than men, for men were bigger and stronger, and wood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze. Finally the wise of both races prevailed, and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small island in the great lake called Gods Eye.   \"There they forged the Pact. The First Men were given the coastlands, the high plains and bright meadows, the mountains and bogs, but the deep woods were to remain forever the children\\'s, and no more weirwoods were to be put to the axe anywhere in the realm. So the gods might bear witness to the signing, every tree on the island was given a face, and afterward, the sacred order of green men was formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces.   \"The Pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children. In time, the First Men even put aside the gods they had brought with them, and took up the worship of the secret gods of the wood. The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age, and began the Age of Heroes.\"   Bran\\'s fist curled around the shiny black arrowhead. \"But the children of the forest are all gone now, you said.\"   \"Here, they are,\" said Osha, as she bit off the end of the last bandage with her teeth. \"North of the Wall, things are different. That\\'s where the children went, and the giants, and the other old races.\"   Maester Luwin sighed. \"Woman, by rights you ought to be dead or in chains. The Starks have treated you more gently than you deserve. It is unkind to repay them for their kindness by filling the boys\\' heads with folly.\"   \"Tell me where they went,\" Bran said. \"I want to know.\"   \"Me too,\" Rickon echoed.   \"Oh, very well,\" Luwin muttered. \"So long as the kingdoms of the First Men held sway, the Pact endured, all through the Age of Heroes and the Long Night and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms, yet finally there came a time, many centuries later, when other peoples crossed the narrow sea.   \"The Andals were the first, a race of tall, fair-haired warriors who came with steel and fire and the seven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests. The wars lasted hundreds of years, but in the end the six southron kingdoms all fell before them. Only here, where the King in the North threw back every army that tried to cross the Neck, did the rule of the First Men endure. The Andals burnt out the weirwood groves, hacked down the faces, slaughtered the children where they found them, and everywhere proclaimed the triumph of the Seven over the old gods. So the children fled north - \"  Summer began to howl.   Maester Luwin broke off, startled. When Shaggydog bounded to his feet and added his voice to his brother\\'s, dread clutched at Bran\\'s heart. \"It\\'s coming,\" he whispered, with the certainty of despair. He had known it since last night, he realized, since the crow had led him down into the crypts to say farewell. He had known it, but he had not believed. He had wanted Maester Luwin to be right. The crow, he thought, the three-eyed crow . . .   The howling stopped as suddenly as it had begun. Summer padded across the tower floor to Shaggydog, and began to lick at a mat of bloody fur on the back of his brother\\'s neck. From the window came a flutter of wings.   A raven landed on the grey stone sill, opened its beak, and gave a harsh, raucous rattle of distress.   Rickon began to cry. His arrowheads fell from his hand one by one and clattered on the floor. Bran pulled him close and hugged him.   Maester Luwin stared at the black bird as if it were a scorpion with feathers. He rose, slow as a sleepwalker, and moved to the window. When he whistled, the raven hopped onto his bandaged forearm. There was dried blood on its wings. \"A hawk,\" Luwin murmured, \"perhaps an owl. Poor thing, a wonder it got through.\" He took the letter from its leg.   Bran found himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper. \"What is it?\" he said, holding his brother all the harder.   \"You know what it is, boy,\" Osha said, not unkindly. She put her hand on his head.   Maester Luwin looked up at them numbly, a small grey man with blood on the sleeve of his grey wool robe and tears in his bright grey eyes. \"My lords,\" he said to the sons, in a voice gone hoarse and shrunken, \"we . . . we shall need to find a stonecarver who knew his likeness well . . . \" ',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 67.     In the tower room at the heart of Maegor\\'s Holdfast, Sansa gave herself to the darkness.   She drew the curtains around her bed, slept, woke weeping, and slept again. When she could not sleep she lay under her blankets shivering with grief. Servants came and went, bringing meals, but the sight of food was more than she could bear. The dishes piled up on the table beneath her window, untouched and spoiling, until the servants took them away again.   Sometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless, and she woke from it more tired than when she had closed her eyes. Yet those were the best times, for when she dreamed, she dreamed of Father. Waking or sleeping, she saw him, saw the gold cloaks fling him down, saw Ser Ilyn striding forward, unsheathing Ice from the scabbard on his back, saw the moment . . . the moment when . . . she had wanted to look away, she had wanted to, her legs had gone out from under her and she had fallen to her knees, yet somehow she could not turn her head, and all the people were screaming and shouting, and her prince had smiled at her, he\\'d smiled and she\\'d felt safe, but only for a heartbeat, until he said those words, and her father\\'s legs . . . that was what she remembered, his legs, the way they\\'d jerked when Ser Ilyn . . . when the sword . . .   Perhaps I will die too, she told herself, and the thought did not seem so terrible to her. If she flung herself from the window, she could put an end to her suffering, and in the years to come the singers would write songs of her grief. Her body would lie on the stones below, broken and innocent, shaming all those who had betrayed her. Sansa went so far as to cross the bedchamber and throw open the shutters . . . but then her courage left her, and she ran back to her bed, sobbing.   The serving girls tried to talk to her when they brought her meals, but she never answered them. Once Grand Maester Pycelle came with a box of flasks and bottles, to ask if she was ill. He felt her brow, made her undress, and touched her all over while her bedmaid held her down. When he left he gave her a potion of honeywater and herbs and told her to drink a swallow every night. She drank it all right then and went back to sleep.   She dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair, an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a man climbed slowly toward her bedchamber, step by step. All she could do was huddle behind her door and listen, trembling, as he came closer and closer. It was Ser Ilyn Payne, she knew, coming for her with Ice in his hand, coming to take her head. There was no place to run, no place to hide, no way to bar the door. Finally the footsteps stopped and she knew he was just outside, standing there silent with his dead eyes and his long pocked face. That was when she realized she was naked. She crouched down, trying to cover herself with her hands, as her door began to swing open, creaking, the point of the greatsword poking through . . .   She woke murmuring, \"Please, please, I\\'ll be good, I\\'ll be good, please don\\'t,\" but there was no one to hear.   When they finally came for her in truth, Sansa never heard their footsteps. It was Joffrey who opened her door, not Ser Ilyn but the boy who had been her prince. She was in bed, curled up tight, her curtains drawn, and she could not have said if it was noon or midnight. The first thing she heard was the slam of the door. Then her bed hangings were yanked back, and she threw up a hand against the sudden light and saw them standing over her.   \"You will attend me in court this afternoon,\" Joffrey said. \"See that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed.\" Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in a plain brown doublet and green mantle, his burned face hideous in the morning light. Behind them were two knights of the Kingsguard in long white satin cloaks.   Sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself. \"No,\" she whimpered, \"please . . . leave me be.\"   \"If you won\\'t rise and dress yourself, my Hound will do it for you,\" Joffrey said.   \"I beg of you, my prince . . . \"   \"I\\'m king now. Dog, get her out of bed.\"   Sandor Clegane scooped her up around the waist and lifted her off the featherbed as she struggled feebly. Her blanket fell to the floor. Underneath she had only a thin bedgown to cover her nakedness. \"Do as you\\'re bid, child,\" Clegane said. \"Dress.\" He pushed her toward her wardrobe, almost gently.   Sansa backed away from them. \"I did as the queen asked, I wrote the letters, I wrote what she told me. You promised you\\'d be merciful. Please, let me go home. I won\\'t do any treason, I\\'ll be good, I swear it, I don\\'t have traitor\\'s blood, I don\\'t. I only want to go home.\" Remembering her courtesies, she lowered her head. \"As it please you,\" she finished weakly.   \"It does not please me,\" Joffrey said. \"Mother says I\\'m still to marry you, so you\\'ll stay here, and you\\'ll obey.\"   \"I don\\'t want to marry you,\" Sansa wailed. \"You chopped off my father\\'s head!\"   \"He was a traitor. I never promised to spare him, only that I\\'d be merciful, and I was. If he hadn\\'t been your father, I would have had him torn or flayed, but I gave him a clean death.\"   Sansa stared at him, seeing him for the first time. He was wearing a padded crimson doublet patterned with lions and a cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar that framed his face. She wondered how she could ever have thought him handsome. His lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain, and his eyes were vain and cruel. \"I hate you,\" she whispered.   King Joffrey\\'s face hardened. \"My mother tells me that it isn\\'t fitting that a king should strike his wife. Ser Meryn.\"   The knight was on her before she could think, yanking back her hand as she tried to shield her face and backhanding her across the ear with a gloved fist. Sansa did not remember failing, yet the next she knew she was sprawled on one knee amongst the rushes. Her head was ringing. Ser Meryn Trant stood over her, with blood on the knuckles of his white silk glove.   \"Will you obey now, or shall I have him chastise you again?\"   Sansa\\'s ear felt numb. She touched it, and her fingertips came away wet and red. \"I . . . as . . . as you command, my lord.\"   \"Your Grace,\" Joffrey corrected her. \"I shall look for you in court.\" He turned and left.   Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out, but Sandor Clegane lingered long enough to yank her roughly to her feet. \"Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.\"   \"What . . . what does he want? Please, tell me.\"   \"He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love,\" the Hound rasped. \"He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you. He wants you to love him . . . and fear him.\"   After he was gone, Sansa sank back onto the rushes, staring at the wall until two of her bedmaids crept timidly into the chamber. \"I will need hot water for my bath, please,\" she told them, \"and perfume, and some powder to hide this bruise.\" The right side of her face was swollen and beginning to ache, but she knew Joffrey would want her to be beautiful.   The hot water made her think of Winterfell, and she took strength from that. She had not washed since the day her father died, and she was startled at how filthy the water became. Her maids sluiced the blood off her face, scrubbed the dirt from her back, washed her hair and brushed it out until it sprang back in thick auburn curls. Sansa did not speak to them, except to give them commands; they were Lannister servants, not her own, and she did not trust them. When the time came to dress, she chose the green silk gown that she had worn to the tourney. She recalled how gallant Joff had been to her that night at the feast. Perhaps it would make him remember as well, and treat her more gently.   She drank a glass of buttermilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits as she waited, to settle her stomach. It was midday when Ser Meryn returned. He had donned his white armor; a shirt of enameled scales chased with gold, a tall helm with a golden sunburst crest, greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of gleaming plate, a heavy wool cloak clasped with a golden lion. His visor had been removed from his helm, to better show his dour face; pouchy bags under his eyes, a wide sour mouth, rusty hair spotted with grey. \"My lady,\" he said, bowing, as if he had not beaten her bloody only three hours past. \"His Grace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room.\"   \"Did he instruct you to hit me if I refused to come?\"   \"Are you refusing to come, my lady?\" The look he gave her was without expression. He did not so much as glance at the bruise he had left her.   He did not hate her, Sansa realized; neither did he love her. He felt nothing for her at all. She was only a . . . a thing to him. \"No,\" she said, rising. She wanted to rage, to hurt him as he\\'d hurt her, to warn him that when she was queen she would have him exiled if he ever dared strike her again . . . but she remembered what the Hound had told her, so all she said was, \"I shall do whatever His Grace commands.\"   \"As I do,\" he replied.   \"Yes . . . but you are no true knight, Ser Meryn.\"   Sandor Clegane would have laughed at that, Sansa knew. Other men might have cursed her, warned her to keep silent, even begged for her forgiveness. Ser Meryn Trant did none of these. Ser Meryn Trant simply did not care.   The balcony was deserted save for Sansa. She stood with her head bowed, fighting to hold back her tears, while below Joffrey sat on his Iron Throne and dispensed what it pleased him to call justice. Nine cases out of ten seemed to bore him; those he allowed his council to handle, squirming restlessly while Lord Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or Queen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did choose to make a ruling, though, not even his queen mother could sway him.   A thief was brought before him and he had Ser Ilyn chop his hand off, right there in court . Two knights came to him with a dispute about some land, and he decreed that they should duel for it on the morrow. \"To the death,\" he added. A woman fell to her knees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor. She had loved him, she said, and she wanted to see him decently buried. \"If you loved a traitor, you must be a traitor too,\" Joffrey said. Two gold cloaks dragged her off to the dungeons.   Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head. But a voice inside her whispered, There are no heroes, and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very hall. \"Life is not a song, sweetling,\" he\\'d told her. \"You may learn that one day to your sorrow.\" In life, the monsters win, she told herself, and now it was the Hound\\'s voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone. \"Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.\"   The last case was a plump tavern singer, accused of making a song that ridiculed the late King Robert. Joff commanded them to fetch his woodharp and ordered him to perform the song for the court. The singer wept and swore he would never sing that song again, but the king insisted. It was sort of a funny song, all about Robert fighting with a pig. The pig was the boar who\\'d killed him, Sansa knew, but in some verses it almost sounded as if he were singing about the queen. When the song was done, Joffrey announced that he\\'d decided to be merciful. The singer could keep either his fingers or his tongue. He would have a day to make his choice. Janos Slynt nodded.   That was the final business of the afternoon, Sansa saw with relief, but her ordeal was not yet done. When the herald\\'s voice dismissed the court, she fled the balcony, only to find Joffrey waiting for her at the base of the curving stairs. The Hound was with him, and Ser Meryn as well. The young king examined her critically, top to bottom. \"You look much better than you did.\"   \"Thank you, Your Grace,\" Sansa said. Hollow words, but they made him nod and smile.   \"Walk with me,\" Joffrey commanded, offering her his arm. She had no choice but to take it. The touch of his hand would have thrilled her once; now it made her flesh crawl. \"My name day will be here soon,\" Joffrey said as they slipped out the rear of the throne room. \"There will be a great feast, and gifts. What are you going to give me?\"   \"I . . . I had not thought, my lord.\"   \"Your Grace,\" he said sharply. \"You truly are a stupid girl, aren\\'t you? My mother says so.\"   \"She does?\" After all that had happened, his words should have lost their power to hurt her, yet somehow they had not. The queen had always been so kind to her.   \"Oh, yes. She worries about our children, whether they\\'ll be stupid like you, but I told her not to trouble herself.\" The king gestured, and Ser Meryn opened a door for them.   \"Thank you, Your Grace,\" she murmured. The Hound was right, she thought, I am only a little bird, repeating the words they taught me. The sun had fallen below the western wall, and the stones of the Red Keep glowed dark as blood.  \"I\\'ll get you with child as soon as you\\'re able,\" Joffrey said as he escorted her across the practice yard. \"If the first one is stupid, I\\'ll chop off your head and find a smarter wife. When do you think you\\'ll be able to have children?\"   Sansa could not look at him, he shamed her so. \"Septa Mordane says most . . . most highborn girls have their flowering at twelve or thirteen.\"   Joffrey nodded. \"This way.\" He led her into the gatehouse, to the base of the steps that led up to the battlements.   Sansa jerked back away from him, trembling. Suddenly she knew where they were going. \"No,\" she said, her voice a frightened gasp. \"Please, no, don\\'t make me, I beg you . . . \"   Joffrey pressed his lips together. \"I want to show you what happens to traitors.\"   Sansa shook her head wildly. \"I won\\'t. I won\\'t.\"   \"I can have Ser Meryn drag you up,\" he said. \"You won\\'t like that. You had better do what I say.\" Joffrey reached for her, and Sansa cringed away from him, backing into the Hound.   \"Do it, girl,\" Sandor Clegane told her, pushing her back toward the king. His mouth twitched on the burned side of his face and Sansa could almost hear the rest of it. He\\'ll have you up there no matter what, so give him what he wants.   She forced herself to take King Joffrey\\'s hand. The climb was something out of a nightmare; every step was a struggle, as if she were pulling her feet out of ankle-deep mud, and there were more steps than she would have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror waiting on the ramparts.   From the high battlements of the gatehouse, the whole world spread out below them. Sansa could see the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya\\'s hill, where her father had died. At the other end of the Street of the Sisters stood the fire-blackened ruins of the Dragonpit. To the west, the swollen red sun was half-hidden behind the Gate of the Gods. The salt sea was at her back, and to the south was the fish market and the docks and the swirling torrent of the Blackwater Rush. And to the north . . .   She turned that way, and saw only the city, streets and alleys and hills and bottoms and more streets and more alleys and the stone of distant walls. Yet she knew that beyond them was open country, farms and fields and forests, and beyond that, north and north and north again, stood Winterfell.   \"What are you looking at?\" Joffrey said. \"This is what I wanted you to see, right here.\"   A thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart, reaching as high as Sansa\\'s chin, with crenellations cut into it every five feet for archers. The heads were mounted between the crenels, along the top of the wall, impaled on iron spikes so they faced out over the city. Sansa had noted them the moment she\\'d stepped out onto the wallwalk, but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were ever so much prettier. He can make me look at the heads, she told herself, but he can\\'t make me see them.   \"This one is your father,\" he said. \"This one here. Dog, turn it around so she can see him.\"   Sandor Clegane took the head by the hair and turned it. The severed head had been dipped in tar to preserve it longer. Sansa looked at it calmly, not seeing it at all. It did not really look like Lord Eddard, she thought; it did not even look real. \"How long do I have to look?\"   Joffrey seemed disappointed. \"Do you want to see the rest?\" There was a long row of them.   \"If it please Your Grace.\"   Joffrey marched her down the wallwalk, past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes. \"I\\'m saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly,\" he explained. The other heads had been dead and mounted much longer than her father. Despite the tar, most were long past being recognizable. The king pointed to one and said, \"That\\'s your septa there,\" but Sansa could not even have told that it was a woman. The jaw had rotted off her face, and birds had eaten one ear and most of a cheek.   Sansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane, although she supposed she had known all along. \"Why did you kill her?\" she asked. \"She was godsworn . . . \"   \"She was a traitor.\" Joffrey looked pouty; somehow she was upsetting him. \"You haven\\'t said what you mean to give me for my name day. Maybe I should give you something instead, would you like that?\"   \"If it please you, my lord,\" Sansa said.   When he smiled, she knew he was mocking her. \"Your brother is a traitor too, you know.\" He turned Septa Mordane\\'s head back around. \"I remember your brother from Winterfell. My dog called him the lord of the wooden sword. Didn\\'t you, dog?\"   \"Did I?\" the Hound replied. \"I don\\'t recall.\"   Joffrey gave a petulant shrug. \"Your brother defeated my uncle Jaime. My mother says it was treachery and deceit. She wept when she heard. Women are all weak, even her, though she pretends she isn\\'t. She says we need to stay in King\\'s Landing in case my other uncles attack, but I don\\'t care. After my name day feast, I\\'m going to raise a host and kill your brother myself. That\\'s what I\\'ll give you, Lady Sansa. Your brother\\'s head.\"   A kind of madness took over her then, and she heard herself say, \"Maybe my brother will give me your head.\"   Joffrey scowled. \"You must never mock me like that. A true wife does not mock her lord. Ser Meryn, teach her.\"   This time the knight grasped her beneath the jaw and held her head still as he struck her. He hit her twice, left to right, and harder, right to left. Her lip split and blood ran down her chin, to mingle with the salt of her tears.   \"You shouldn\\'t be crying all the time,\" Joffrey told her. \"You\\'re more pretty when you smile and laugh.\"   Sansa made herself smile, afraid that he would have Ser Meryn hit her again if she did not, but it was no good, the king still shook his head. \"Wipe off the blood, you\\'re all messy.\"   The outer parapet came up to her chin, but along the inner edge of the walk was nothing, nothing but a long plunge to the bailey seventy or eighty feet below. All it would take was a shove, she told herself. He was standing right there, right there, smirking at her with those fat wormlips. You could do it, she told herself. You could. Do it right now. It wouldn\\'t even matter if she went over with him. It wouldn\\'t matter at all.   \"Here, girl.\" Sandor Clegane knelt before her, between her and Joffrey. With a delicacy surprising in such a big man, he dabbed at the blood welling from her broken lip.   The moment was gone. Sansa lowered her eyes. \"Thank you,\" she said when he was done. She was a good girl, and always remembered her courtesies. ',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 68.      Wings shadowed her fever dreams.   \"You don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"   She was walking down a long hall beneath high stone arches. She could not look behind her, must not look behind her. There was a door ahead of her, tiny with distance, but even from afar, she saw that it was painted red. She walked faster, and her bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone.   \"You don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"   She saw sunlight on the Dothraki sea, the living plain, rich with the smells of earth and death. Wind stirred the grasses, and they rippled like water. Drogo held her in strong arms, and his hand stroked her sex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone, and the stars smiled down on them, stars in a daylight sky. \"Home,\" she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed, but suddenly the stars were gone, and across the blue sky swept the great wings, and the world took flame.   \" . . . don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"   Ser Jorah\\'s face was drawn and sorrowful. \"Rhaegar was the last dragon,\" he told her. He warmed translucent hands over a glowing brazier where stone eggs smouldered red as coals. One moment he was there and the next he was fading, his flesh colorless, less substantial than the wind. \"The last dragon,\" he whispered, thin as a wisp, and was gone. She felt the dark behind her, and the red door seemed farther away than ever.   \" . . . don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\"   Viserys stood before her, screaming. \"The dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. I am the dragon, and I will be crowned.\" The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep channels in his flesh. \"I am the dragon and I will be crowned!\" he shrieked, and his fingers snapped like snakes, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks.   \" . . . don\\'t want to wake the dragon . . . \"   The red door was so far ahead of her, and she could feel the icy breath behind, sweeping up on her. If it caught her she would die a death that was more than death, howling forever alone in the darkness. She began to run.   \" . . . don\\'t want to wake the dragon . . . \"   She could feel the heat inside her, a terrible burning in her womb. Her son was tall and proud, with Drogo\\'s copper skin and her own silver-gold hair, violet eyes shaped like almonds. And he smiled for her and began to lift his hand toward hers, but when he opened his mouth the fire poured out. She saw his heart burning through his chest, and in an instant he was gone, consumed like a moth by a candle, turned to ash. She wept for her child, the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast, but her tears turned to steam as they touched her skin.   \" . . . want to wake the dragon . . . \"   Ghosts lined the hallway, dressed in the faded raiment of kings. In their hands were swords of pale fire. They had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white, and their eyes were opal and amethyst, tourmaline and jade. \"Faster,\" they cried, \"faster, faster.\" She raced, her feet melting the stone wherever they touched. \"Faster!\" the ghosts cried as one, and she screamed and threw herself forward. A great knife of pain ripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew.   \" . . . wake the dragon . . . \"   The door loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings. She could smell home, she could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm, there. She threw open the door.   \" . . . the dragon . . . \"   And saw her brother Rhaegar, mounted on a stallion as black as his armor. Fire glimmered red through the narrow eye slit of his helm. \"The last dragon,\" Ser Jorah\\'s voice whispered faintly. \"The last, the last.\" Dany lifted his polished black visor. The face within was her own.   After that, for a long time, there was only the pain, the fire within her, and the whisperings of stars.   She woke to the taste of ashes.   \"No,\" she moaned, \"no, please.\"   \"Khaleesi?\" Jhiqui hovered over her, a frightened doe.   The tent was drenched in shadow, still and close. Flakes of ash drifted upward from a brazier, and Dany followed them with her eyes through the smoke hole above. Flying, she thought. I had wings, I was flying. But it was only a dream. \"Help me,\" she whispered, struggling to rise. \"Bring me . . . \" Her voice was raw as a wound, and she could not think what she wanted. Why did she hurt so much? It was as if her body had been torn to pieces and remade from the scraps. \"I want . . . \"   \"Yes, Khaleesi.\" Quick as that Jhiqui was gone, bolting from the tent, shouting. Dany needed . . . something . . . someone . . . what? It was important, she knew. It was the only thing in the world that mattered. She rolled onto her side and got an elbow under her, fighting the blanket tangled about her legs. It was so hard to move. The world swam dizzily. I have to . . .   They found her on the carpet, crawling toward her dragon eggs. Ser Jorah Mormont lifted her in his arms and carried her back to her sleeping silks, while she struggled feebly against him. Over his shoulder she saw her three handmaids, Jhogo with his little wisp of mustache, and the flat broad face of Mirri Maz Duur. \"I must,\" she tried to tell them, \"I have to . . . \"   \" . . . sleep, Princess,\" Ser Jorah said.   \"No,\" Dany said. \"Please. Please.\"   \"Yes.\" He covered her with silk, though she was burning. \"Sleep and grow strong again, Khaleesi. Come back to us.\" And then Mirri Maz Duur was there, the maegi, tipping a cup against her lips. She tasted sour milk, and something else, something thick and bitter. Warm liquid ran down her chin. Somehow she swallowed. The tent grew dimmer, and sleep took her again. This time she did not dream. She floated, serene and at peace, on a black sea that knew no shore.   After a time - a night, a day, a year, she could not say - she woke again. The tent was dark, its silken walls flapping like wings when the wind gusted outside. This time Dany did not attempt to rise. \"Irri,\" she called, \"Jhiqui. Doreah.\" They were there at once. \"My throat is dry,\" she said, \"so dry,\" and they brought her water. It was warm and flat, yet Dany drank it eagerly, and sent Jhiqui for more. Irri dampened a soft cloth and stroked her brow. \"I have been sick,\" Dany said. The Dothraki girl nodded. \"How long?\" The cloth was soothing, but Irri seemed so sad, it frightened her. \"Long,\" she whispered. When Jhiqui returned with more water, Mirri Maz Duur came with her, eyes heavy from sleep. \"Drink,\" she said, lifting Dany\\'s head to the cup once more, but this time it was only wine. Sweet, sweet wine. Dany drank, and lay back, listening to the soft sound of her own breathing. She could feel the heaviness in her limbs, as sleep crept in to fill her up once more. \"Bring me . . . \" she murmured, her voice slurred and drowsy. \"Bring . . . I want to hold . . . \"   \"Yes?\" the maegi asked. \"What is it you wish, Khaleesi?\"   \"Bring me . . . egg . . . dragon\\'s egg . . . please . . . \" Her lashes turned to lead, and she was too weary to hold them up.   When she woke the third time, a shaft of golden sunlight was pouring through the smoke hole of the tent, and her arms were wrapped around a dragon\\'s egg. It was the pale one, its scales the color of butter cream, veined with whorls of gold and bronze, and Dany could feel the heat of it. Beneath her bedsilks, a fine sheen of perspiration covered her bare skin. Dragondew, she thought. Her fingers trailed lightly across the surface of the shell, tracing the wisps of gold, and deep in the stone she felt something twist and stretch in response. It did not frighten her. All her fear was gone, burned away.   Dany touched her brow. Under the film of sweat, her skin was cool to the touch, her fever gone. She made herself sit. There was a moment of dizziness, and the deep ache between her thighs. Yet she felt strong. Her maids came running at the sound of her voice. \"Water,\" she told them, \"a flagon of water, cold as you can find it. And fruit, I think. Dates.\"  \"As you say, Khaleesi.\"   \"I want Ser Jorah,\" she said, standing. Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped it over her shoulders. \"And a warm bath, and Mirri Maz Duur, and . . . \" Memory came back to her all at once, and she faltered. \"Khal Drogo,\" she forced herself to say, watching their faces with dread. \"Is he&amp;mdash?\"   \"The khal lives,\" Irri answered quietly . . . yet Dany saw a darkness in her eyes when she said the words, and no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to fetch water.   She turned to Doreah. \"Tell me.\"   \"I . . . I shall bring Ser Jorah,\" the Lysene girl said, bowing her head and fleeing the tent.   Jhiqui would have run as well, but Dany caught her by the wrist and held her captive. \"What is it? I must know. Drogo . . . and my child.\" Why had she not remembered the child until now? \"My son . . . Rhaego . . . where is he? I want him.\"   Her handmaid lowered her eyes. \"The boy . . . he did not live, Khaleesi.\" Her voice was a frightened whisper.   Dany released her wrist. My son is dead, she thought as Jhiqui left the tent. She had known somehow. She had known since she woke the first time to Jhiqui\\'s tears. No, she had known before she woke. Her dream came back to her, sudden and vivid, and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silver-gold braid, bursting into flame.   She should weep, she knew, yet her eyes were dry as ash. She had wept in her dream, and the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks. All the grief has been burned out of me, she told herself. She felt sad, and yet . . . she could feel Rhaego receding from her, as if he had never been.   Ser Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later, and found Dany standing over the other dragon\\'s eggs, the two still in their chest. It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with, which was passing strange. \"Ser Jorah, come here,\" she said. She took his hand and placed it on the black egg with the scarlet swirls. \"What do you feel?\"   \"Shell, hard as rock.\" The knight was wary. \"Scales.\"   \"Heat?\"   \"No. Cold stone.\" He took his hand away. \"Princess, are you well? Should you be up, weak as you are?\"   \"Weak? I am strong, Jorah.\" To please him, she reclined on a pile of cushions. \"Tell me how my child died.\"   \"He never lived, my princess. The women say . . . \" He faltered, and Dany saw how the flesh hung loose on him, and the way he limped when he moved.   \"Tell me. Tell me what the women say.\"   He turned his face away. His eyes were haunted. \"They say the child was . . . \"   She waited, but Ser Jorah could not say it. His face grew dark with shame. He looked half a corpse himself.   \"Monstrous,\" Mirri Maz Duur finished for him . The knight was a powerful man, yet Dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger, and crueler, and infinitely more dangerous. \"Twisted. I drew him forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat. When I touched him, the flesh sloughed off the bone, and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption. He had been dead for years.\"   Darkness, Dany thought. The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her. If she looked back she was lost. \"My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent,\" she said. \"I could feel him kicking, fighting to be born.\"   \"That may be as it may be,\" answered Mirri Maz Duur, \"yet the creature that came forth from your womb was as I said. Death was in that tent, Khaleesi.\"   \"Only shadows,\" Ser Jorah husked, but Dany could hear the doubt in his voice. \"I saw, maegi. I saw you, alone, dancing with the shadows. \"   \"The grave casts long shadows, Iron Lord,\" Mirri said. \"Long and dark, and in the end no light can hold them back.\"   Ser Jorah had killed her son, Dany knew. He had done what he did for love and loyalty, yet he had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness. He knew it too; the grey face, the hollow eyes, the limp. \"The shadows have touched you too, Ser Jorah,\" she told him. The knight made no reply. Dany turned to the godswife. \"You warned me that only death could pay for life. I thought you meant the horse.\"   \"No,\" Mirri Maz Duur said. \"That was a lie you told yourself. You knew the price.\"   Had she? Had she? If I look back I am lost. \"The price was paid,\" Dany said. \"The horse, my child, Quaro and Qotho, Haggo and Cohollo. The price was paid and paid and paid.\" She rose from her cushions. \"Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me, godswife, maegi, bloodmage, whatever you are. Show me Khal Drogo. Show me what I bought with my son\\'s life.\"   \"As you command, Khaleesi,\" the old woman said. \"Come, I will take you to him.\"   Dany was weaker than she knew. Ser Jorah slipped an arm around her and helped her stand. \"Time enough for this later, my princess,\" he said quietly.   \"I would see him now, Ser Jorah.\"   After the dimness of the tent, the world outside was blinding bright. The sun burned like molten gold, and the land was seared and empty. Her handmaids waited with fruit and wine and water, and Jhogo moved close to help Ser Jorah support her. Aggo and Rakharo stood behind. The glare of sun on sand made it hard to see more, until Dany raised her hand to shade her eyes. She saw the ashes of a fire, a few score horses milling listlessly and searching for a bite of grass, a scattering of tents and bedrolls. A small crowd of children had gathered to watch her, and beyond she glimpsed women going about their work, and withered old men staring at the flat blue sky with tired eyes, swatting feebly at bloodflies. A count might show a hundred people, no more. Where the other forty thousand had made their camp, only the wind and dust lived now.   \"Drogo\\'s khalasar is gone,\" she said.   \"A khal who cannot ride is no khal,\" said Jhogo.   \"The Dothraki follow only the strong,\" Ser Jorah said. \"I am sorry, my princess. There was no way to hold them. Ko Pono left first, naming himself Khal Pono, and many followed him. Jhaqo was not long to do the same. The rest slipped away night by night, in large bands and small. There are a dozen new khalasars on the Dothraki sea, where once there was only Drogo\\'s.\"   \"The old remain,\" said Aggo. \"The frightened, the weak, and the sick. And we who swore. We remain.\"   \"They took Khal Drogo\\'s herds, Khaleesi,\" Rakharo said. \"We were too few to stop them. It is the right of the strong to take from the weak. They took many slaves as well, the khal\\'s and yours, yet they left some few.\"   \"Eroeh?\" asked Dany, remembering the frightened child she had saved outside the city of the Lamb Men.   \"Mago seized her, who is Khal Jhaqo\\'s bloodrider now,\" said Jhogo. \"He mounted her high and low and gave her to his khal, and Jhaqo gave her to his other bloodriders. They were six. When they were done with her, they cut her throat.\"   \"It was her fate, Khaleesi,\" said Aggo.   If I look back I am lost. \"It was a cruel fate,\" Dany said, \"yet not so cruel as Mago\\'s will be. I promise you that, by the old gods and the new, by the lamb god and the horse god and every god that lives. I swear it by the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the World. Before I am done with them, Mago and Ko Jhaqo will plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh.\"   The Dothraki exchanged uncertain glances. \"Khaleesi, \" the handmaid Irri explained, as if to a child, \"Jhaqo is a khal now, with twenty thousand riders at his back.\"   She lifted her head. \"And I am Daenerys Stormhorn, Daenerys of House Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel and old Valyria before them. I am the dragon\\'s daughter, and I swear to you, these men will die screaming. Now bring me to Khal Drogo.\"   He was lying on the bare red earth, staring up at the sun.   A dozen bloodflies had settled on his body, though he did not seem to feel them. Dany brushed them away and knelt beside him. His eyes were wide open but did not see, and she knew at once that he was blind. When she whispered his name, he did not seem to hear. The wound on his breast was as healed as it would ever be, the scar that covered it grey and red and hideous.   \"Why is he out here alone, in the sun?\" she asked them.   \"He seems to like the warmth, Princess,\" Ser Jorah said. \"His eyes follow the sun, though he does not see it. He can walk after a fashion. He will go where you lead him, but no farther. He will eat if you put food in his mouth, drink if you dribble water on his lips.\"   Dany kissed her sun-and-stars gently on the brow, and stood to face Mirri Maz Duur. \"Your spells are costly, maegi.\"   \"He lives,\" said Mirri Maz Duur. \"You asked for life. You paid for life.\"   \"This is not life, for one who was as Drogo was. His life was laughter, and meat roasting over a firepit, and a horse between his legs. His life was an arakh in his hand and his bells ringing in his hair as he rode to meet an enemy. His life was his bloodriders, and me, and the son I was to give him.\"   Mirri Maz Duur made no reply.   \"When will he be as he was?\" Dany demanded.   \"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\" said Mirri Maz Duur. \"When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.\"   Dany gestured at Ser Jorah and the others. \"Leave us. I would speak with this maegi alone.\" Mormont and the Dothraki withdrew. \"You knew,\" Dany said when they were gone. She ached, inside and out, but her fury gave her strength. \"You knew what I was buying, and you knew the price, and yet you let me pay it.\"   \"It was wrong of them to burn my temple,\" the heavy, flat-nosed woman said placidly. \"That angered the Great Shepherd.\"   \"This was no god\\'s work,\" Dany said coldly. If I look back I am lost. \"You cheated me. You murdered my child within me.\"   \"The stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now. His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.\"   \"I spoke for you,\" she said, anguished. \"I saved you.\"   \"Saved me?\" The Lhazareen woman spat. \"Three riders had taken me, not as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth was in me when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god\\'s house burn, where I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned as well, and in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of a baker who made my bread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons past. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips. Tell me again what you saved.\"   \"Your life.\"   Mirri Maz Duur laughed cruelly. \"Look to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is gone.\"   Dany called out for the men of her khas and bid them take Mirri Maz Duur and bind her hand and foot, but the maegi smiled at her as they carried her off, as if they shared a secret. A word, and Dany could have her head off . . . yet then what would she have? A head? If life was worthless, what was death?   They led Khal Drogo back to her tent, and Dany commanded them to fill a tub, and this time there was no blood in the water. She bathed him herself, washing the dirt and the dust from his arms and chest, cleaning his face with a soft cloth, soaping his long black hair and combing the knots and tangles from it till it shone again as she remembered. It was well past dark before she was done, and Dany was exhausted. She stopped for drink and food, but it was all she could do to nibble at a fig and keep down a mouthful of water. Sleep would have been a release, but she had slept enough . . . too long, in truth. She owed this night to Drogo, for all the nights that had been, and yet might be.   The memory of their first ride was with her when she led him out into the darkness, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man\\'s life must be done beneath the open sky. She told herself that there were powers stronger than hatred, and spells older and truer than any the maegi had learned in Asshai. The night was black and moonless, but overhead a million stars burned bright. She took that for an omen.   No soft blanket of grass welcomed them here, only the hard dusty ground, bare and strewn with stones. No trees stirred in the wind, and there was no stream to soothe her fears with the gentle music of water. Dany told herself that the stars would be enough. \"Remember, Drogo,\" she whispered. \"Remember our first ride together, the day we wed. Remember the night we made Rhaego, with the khalasar all around us and your eyes on my face. Remember how cool and clean the water was in the Womb of the World. Remember, my sun-and-stars. Remember, and come back to me.\"   The birth had left her too raw and torn to take him inside of her, as she would have wanted, but Doreah had taught her other ways. Dany used her hands, her mouth, her breasts. She raked him with her nails and covered him with kisses and whispered and prayed and told him stories, and by the end she had bathed him with her tears. Yet Drogo did not feel, or speak, or rise.   And when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon, Dany knew that he was truly lost to her. \"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\" she said sadly. \"When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When my womb quickens again, and I bear a living child. Then you will return, my sun-and-stars, and not before.\"   Never, the darkness cried, never never never.   Inside the tent Dany found a cushion, soft silk stuffed with feathers. She clutched it to her br  sts as she walked back out to Drogo, to her sun-and-stars. If I look back I am lost. It hurt even to walk, and she wanted to sleep, to sleep and not to dream.   She knelt, kissed Drogo on the lips, and pressed the cushion down across his face.  Kapitel 69.   Tyrion   They have my son,\" Tywin Lannister said.   \"They do, my lord.\" The messenger\\'s voice was dulled by exhaustion. On the breast of his torn surcoat, the brindled boar of Crakehall was half-obscured by dried blood.   One of your sons, Tyrion thought. He took a sip of wine and said not a word, thinking of Jaime. When he lifted his arm, pain shot through his elbow, reminding him of his own brief taste of battle. He loved his brother, but he would not have wanted to be with him in the Whispering Wood for all the gold in Casterly Rock.   His lord father\\'s assembled captains and bannermen had fallen very quiet as the courier told his tale. The only sound was the crackle and hiss of the log burning in the hearth at the end of the long, drafty common room.   After the hardships of the long relentless drive south, the prospect of even a single night in an inn had cheered Tyrion mightily . . . though he rather wished it had not been this inn again, with all its memories. His father had set a grueling pace, and it had taken its toll. Men wounded in the battle kept up as best they could or were abandoned to fend for themselves. Every morning they left a few more by the roadside, men who went to sleep never to wake. Every afternoon a few more collapsed along the way. And every evening a few more deserted, stealing off into the dusk. Tyrion had been half-tempted to go with them.  He had been upstairs, enjoying the comfort of a featherbed and the warmth of Shae\\'s body beside him, when his squire had woken him to say that a rider had arrived with dire news of Riverrun. So it had all been for nothing. The rush south, the endless forced marches, the bodies left beside the road . . . all for naught. Robb Stark had reached Riverrun days and days ago.   \"How could this happen?\" Ser Harys Swyft moaned. \"How? Even after the Whispering Wood, you had Riverrun ringed in iron, surrounded by a great host . . . what madness made Ser Jaime decide to split his men into three separate camps? Surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them?\"   Better than you, you chinless craven, Tyrion thought. Jaime might have lost Riverrun, but it angered him to hear his brother slandered by the likes of Swyft, a shameless lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment was marrying his equally chinless daughter to Ser Kevan, and thereby attaching himself to the Lannisters.   \"I would have done the same,\" his uncle responded, a good deal more calmly than Tyrion might have. \"You have never seen Riverrun, Ser Harys, or you would know that Jaime had little choice in the matter. The castle is situated at the end of the point of land where the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of the Trident. The rivers form two sides of a triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open their sluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun into an island. The walls rise sheer from the water, and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues around. To cut off all the approaches, a besieger must needs place one camp north of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and a third between the rivers, west of the moat. There is no other way, none.\"   \"Ser Kevan speaks truly, my lords,\" the courier said. \"We\\'d built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers cutting us off from each other. They came down on the north camp first. No one was expecting an attack. Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains, but he had no more than fifty men. Ser Jaime had gone out to deal with them the night before . . . well, with what we thought was them. We were told the Stark host was east of the Green Fork, marching south . . . \"   \"And your outriders?\" Ser Gregor Clegane\\'s face might have been hewn from rock. The fire in the hearth gave a somber orange cast to his skin and put deep shadows in the hollows of his eyes. \"They saw nothing? They gave you no warning?\"   The bloodstained messenger shook his head. \"Our outriders had been vanishing. Marq Piper\\'s work, we thought. The ones who did come back had seen nothing.\"   \"A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes,\" the Mountain declared. \"Cut them out and give them to your next outrider. Tell him you hope that four eyes might see better than two . . . and if not, the man after him will have six.\"   Lord Tywin Lannister turned his face to study Ser Gregor. Tyrion saw a glimmer of gold as the light shone off his father\\'s pupils, but he could not have said whether the look was one of approval or disgust. Lord Tywin was oft quiet in council, preferring to listen before he spoke, a habit Tyrion himself tried to emulate. Yet this silence was uncharacteristic even for him, and his wine was untouched.   \"You said they came at night,\" Ser Kevan prompted.   The man gave a weary nod. \"The Blackfish led the van, cutting down our sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault. By the time our men knew what was happening, riders were pouring over the ditch banks and galloping through the camp with swords and torches in hand. I was sleeping in the west camp, between the rivers. When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord Brax led us to the rafts and we tried to pole across, but the current pushed us downstream and the Tullys started flinging rocks at us with the catapults on their walls. I saw one raft smashed to kindling and three others overturned, men swept into the river and drowned . . . and those who did make it across found the Starks waiting for them on the riverbanks.\"   Ser Flement Brax wore a silver-and-purple tabard and the look of a man who cannot comprehend what he has just heard. \"My lord father - \"   \"Sorry, my lord,\" the messenger said. \"Lord Brax was clad in plate-and-mail when his raft overturned. He was very gallant.\"   He was a fool, Tyrion thought, swirling his cup and staring down into the winy depths. Crossing a river at night on a crude raft, wearing armor, with an enemy waiting on the other side - if that was gallantry, he would take cowardice every time. He wondered if Lord Brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of his steel pulled him under the black water.   \"The camp between the rivers was overrun as well,\" the messenger was saying. \"While we were trying to cross, more Starks swept in from the west, two columns of armored horse. I saw Lord Umber\\'s giant-in-chains and the Mallister eagle, but it was the boy who led them, with a monstrous wolf running at his side. I wasn\\'t there to see, but it\\'s said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses. Our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but when the Tullys saw them engaged, they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took them in the rear.\"   \"Gods save us,\" Lord Lefford swore.   \"Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made off with them all. Our south camp was under the command of Ser Forley Prester. He retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two thousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his banners and went over to the foe.\"   \"Curse the man.\" His uncle Kevan sounded more angry than surprised. \"I warned Jaime not to trust that one. A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse.\"   Lord Tywin wove his fingers together under his chin. Only his eyes moved as he listened. His bristling golden side-whiskers framed a face so still it might have been a mask, but Tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling his father\\'s shaven head.   \"How could it happen?\" Ser Harys Swyft wailed again. \"Ser Jaime taken, the siege broken . . . this is a catastrophe!\"   Ser Addam Marbrand said, \"I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious, Ser Harys. The question is, what shall we do about it?\"   \"What can we do? Jaime\\'s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight, and the Starks and the Tullys sit squarely across our line of supply. We are cut off from the west! They can march on Casterly Rock if they so choose, and what\\'s to stop them? My lords, we are beaten. We must sue for peace.\"   \"Peace?\" Tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully, took a deep draft, and hurled his empty cup to the floor, where it shattered into a thousand pieces. \"There\\'s your peace, Ser Harys. My sweet nephew broke it for good and all when he decided to ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard\\'s head. You\\'ll have an easier time drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace now. He\\'s winning . . . or hadn\\'t you noticed?\"   \"Two battles do not make a war,\" Ser Addam insisted. \"We are far from lost. I should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy.\"   \"Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs,\" offered Lord Lefford.   \"Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come out light on those scales,\" Tyrion said acidly. \"And what are we to offer for my brother? Lord Eddard\\'s rotting head?\"   \"I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hand\\'s daughters,\" Lefford said hopefully. \"If we give the lad his sisters back . . . \"   Ser Addam snorted disdainfully. \"He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime Lannister\\'s life for two girls.\"   \"Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs,\" Lord Lefford said.   Tyrion rolled his eyes. \"If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt down Jaime\\'s armor.\"   \"if we ask for a truce, they will think us weak,\" Ser Addarn argued . \"We should march on them at once.\"   \"Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops,\" said Ser Harys. \"And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host.\"   Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet. \"They have my son,\" he said once more, in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet. \"Leave me. All of you.\"   Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father gave him a look. \"Not you, Tyrion. Remain. And you as well, Kevan. The rest of you, out.\"   Tyrion eased himself back onto the bench, startled into speechlessness. Ser Kevan crossed the room to the wine casks. \"Uncle,\" Tyrion called, \"if you would be so kind - \"   \"Here.\" His father offered him his cup, the wine untouched.   Now Tyrion truly was nonplussed. He drank.   Lord Tywin seated himself. \"You have the right of it about Stark. Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert\\'s brothers. Dead . . . \" His hand curled into a fist. \"Madness. Rank madness.\"   \"Joff\\'s only a boy,\" Tyrion pointed out. \"At his age, I committed a few follies of my own.\"   His father gave him a sharp look. \"I suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet married a whore.\"   Tyrion sipped at his wine, wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung the cup in his face.   \"Our position is worse than you know,\" his father went on. \"It would seem we have a new king.\"   Ser Kevan looked poleaxed. \"A new - who? What have they done to Joffrey?\"   The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin\\'s thin lips. \"Nothing . . . yet. My grandson still sits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south. Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past, and now he has claimed the crown. The bride\\'s father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords.\"   \"Those are grave tidings.\" When Ser Kevan frowned, the furrows in his brow grew deep as canyons.   \"My daughter commands us to ride for King\\'s Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers.\" His mouth tightened. \"Commands us, mind you. In the name of the king and council.\"   \"How is King Joffrey taking the news?\" Tyrion asked with a certain black amusement.   \"Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,\" Lord Tywin said. \"She fears he might insist on marching against Renly himself.\"   \"With what army?\" Tyrion asked. \"You don\\'t plan to give him this one, I hope?\"   \"He talks of leading the City Watch,\" Lord Tywin said.   \"If he takes the Watch, he\\'ll leave the city undefended,\" Ser Kevan said. \"And with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone . . . \"   \"Yes.\" Lord Tywin looked down at his son. \"I had thought you were the one made for motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.\"   \"Why, Father,\" said Tyrion, \"that almost sounds like praise.\" He leaned forward intently. \"What of Stannis? He\\'s the elder, not Renly. How does he feel about his brother\\'s claim?\"   His father frowned. \"I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined. Yet he does nothing. Oh, Varys hears his whispers. Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai. What does it mean? Is any of it true?\" He gave an irritated shrug. \"Kevan, bring us the map.\"   Ser Kevan did as he was bid. Lord Tywin unrolled the leather, smoothing it flat. \"Jaime has left us in a bad way. Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us. Our enemies hold the Twins and Moat Cailin. Robb Stark sits to the west, so we cannot retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we choose to give battle. Jaime is taken, and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist. Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion continue to plague our foraging parties. To our east we have the Arryns, Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south Highgarden and Storm\\'s End are calling their banners.\"   Tyrion smiled crookedly. \"Take heart, Father. At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead.\"   \"I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes, Tyrion,\" Lord Tywin Lannister said.   Ser Kevan frowned over the map, forehead creasing. \"Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now. Their combined power may exceed our own. And with Roose Bolton behind us . . . Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be caught between three armies.\"   \"I have no intention of remaining here. We must finish our business with young Lord Stark before Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden. Bolton does not concern me. He is a wary man, and we made him warier on the Green Fork. He will be slow to give pursuit. So . . . on the morrow, we make for Harrenhal. Kevan, I want Ser Addam\\'s outriders to screen our movements. Give him as many men as he requires, and send them out in groups of four. I will have no vanishings.\"   \"As you say, my lord, but . . . why Harrenhal? That is a grim, unlucky place. Some call it cursed.\"   \"Let them,\" Lord Tywin said. \"Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us with his reavers. Send forth Vargo Hoat and his freeriders as well, and Ser Amory Lorch. Each is to have three hundred horse. Tell them I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.\"   \"They will burn, my lord,\" Ser Kevan said, rising. \"I shall give the commands.\" He bowed and made for the door.   When they were alone, Lord Tywin glanced at Tyrion. \"Your savages might relish a bit of rapine. Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they like - goods, stock, women, they may take what they want and burn the rest.\"   \"Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow,\" Tyrion commented, \"but I should prefer to keep them with me.\" Uncouth and unruly they might be, yet the wildlings were his, and he trusted them more than any of his father\\'s men. He was not about to hand them over.   \"Then you had best learn to control them. I will not have the city plundered.\"   \"The city?\" Tyrion was lost. \"What city would that be?\"   \"King\\'s Landing. I am sending you to court.\"   It was the last thing Tyrion Lannister would ever have anticipated.   He reached for his wine, and considered for a moment as he sipped. \"And what am I to do there?\"  \"Rule,\" his father said curtly   Tyrion hooted with laughter. \"My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that!\"   \"Let her say what she likes. Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all. I blame those jackanapes on the council - our friend Petyr, the venerable Grand Maester, and that cockless wonder Lord Varys. What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next? Whose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord? The man\\'s father was a butcher, and they grant him Harrenhal. Harrenhal, that was the seat of kings! Not that he will ever set foot inside it, if I have a say. I am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil. A bloody cleaver would have been my choice.\" His father had not raised his voice, yet Tyrion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes. \"And dismissing Selmy, where was the sense in that? Yes, the man was old, but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning in the realm. He lent honor to any man he served. Can anyone say the same of the Hound? You feed your dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench.\" He pointed a finger at Tyrion\\'s face. \"If Cersei cannot curb the boy, you must. And if these councillors are playing us false . . . \"   Tyrion knew. \"Spikes,\" he sighed. \"Heads. Walls.\"   \"I see you have taken a few lessons from me.\"   \"More than you know, Father,\" Tyrion answered quietly. He finished his wine and set the cup aside, thoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit. Another part was remembering the battle upriver, and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again. \"Why me?\" he asked, cocking his head to one side. \"Why not my uncle? Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett? Why not a . . . bigger man?\"   Lord Tywin rose abruptly. \"You are my son.\"   That was when he knew. You have given him up for lost, he thought. You bloody bastard, you think Jaime\\'s good as dead, so I\\'m all you have left. Tyrion wanted to slap him, to spit in his face, to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold, the way the smallfolks said. Yet he sat there, silent and still.   The shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father\\'s heels as Lord Tywin crossed the room. \"One last thing,\" he said at the door. \"You will not take the whore to court.\"   Tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was gone. Finally he climbed the steps to his cozy garret beneath the bell tower. The ceiling was low, but that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf. From the window, he could see the gibbet his father had erected in the yard. The innkeep\\'s body turned slowly on its rope whenever the night wind gusted. Her flesh had grown as thin and ragged as Lannister hopes.   Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the featherbed. He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her eyes opened. \"M\\'lord,\" she said with a drowsy smile.   When he felt her nipple stiffen, Tyrion kissed her. \"I have a mind to take you to King\\'s Landing, sweetling,\" he whispered.',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 7.   Arya   Arya\\'s stitches were crooked again.   She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa\\'s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \"Sansa\\'s work is as pretty as she is,\" Septa Mordane told their lady mother once. \"She has such fine, delicate hands.\" When Lady Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. \"Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.\"   Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but the septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and admiration. It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, as she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella\\'s stitches looked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing.   She studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the needle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik\\'s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear.   \"What are you talking about?\" Arya asked suddenly.   Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered.   \"Tell me,\" Arya said.   Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then, and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies.   \"We were talking about the prince,\" Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss.   Arya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got to sit with him at the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally.   \"Joffrey likes your sister,\" Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell\\'s steward and Sansa\\'s dearest friend. \"He told her she was very beautiful.\"   \"He\\'s going to marry her,\" little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \"Then Sansa will be queen of all the realm.\"   Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull resentment. \"Beth, you shouldn\\'t make up stories,\" Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \"What did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He\\'s very gallant, don\\'t you think?\"   \"Jon says he looks like a girl,\" Arya said.   Sansa sighed as she stitched. \"Poor Jon,\" she said. \"He gets jealous because he\\'s a bastard.\"   \"He\\'s our brother,\" Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room.   Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning. It was frowning now. \"What are you talking about, children?\"   \"Our half brother,\" Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. \"Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,\" she said.   Septa Mordane nodded. \"Indeed. A great honor for us all.\" Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment. \"Arya, why aren\\'t you at work?\" the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. \"Let me see your stitches.\"   Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\\'s attention. \"Here,\" she said, surrendering up her work.   The septa examined the fabric. \"Arya, Arya, Arya,\" she said. \"This will not do. This will not do at all.\"   Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\\'s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door.   Septa Mordane called after her. \"Arya, come back here! Don\\'t you take another step! Your lady mother will hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! You\\'ll shame us all!\"   Arya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down her cheeks now. She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. \"By your leave, my lady.\"   Myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain, Septa Mordane was not. \"Just where do you think you are going, Arya?\" the septa demanded.   Arya glared at her. \"I have to go shoe a horse,\" she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septa\\'s face. Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her.   It wasn\\'t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their mother\\'s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward.   Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about her stitches then.   Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had named her pup \"Lady.\" Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she giggled.   By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \"Come,\" she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.   There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a view of the whole yard. That was where they headed.   They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. He was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down.   Jon gave her a curious look. \"Shouldn\\'t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\"   Arya made a face at him. \"I wanted to see them fight.\"   He smiled. \"Come here, then.\"   Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.   To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling . Bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed positively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, Robb\\'s voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the combatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile.   \"A shade more exhausting than needlework,\" Jon observed.   \"A shade more fun than needlework,\" Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\\'s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.   \"Why aren\\'t you down in the yard?\" Arya asked him.   He gave her a half smile. \"Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\" he said. \"Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\"   \"Oh.\" Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.   She watched her little brother whack at Tommen. \"I could do just as good as Bran,\" she said. \"He\\'s only seven. I\\'m nine.\"   Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \"You\\'re too skinny,\" he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \"I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.\"   Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and Tommen circle each other.   \"You see Prince Joffrey?\" Jon asked.   She hadn\\'t, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised.   \"Look at the arms on his surcoat,\" Jon suggested.   Arya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince\\'s padded surcoat. No doubt the needlework was exquisite. The arms were pided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag of the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister.   \"The Lannisters are proud,\" Jon observed. \"You\\'d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother\\'s House equal in honor to the king\\'s.\"   \"The woman is important too!\" Arya protested.   Jon chuckled. \"Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\"   \"A wolf with a fish in its mouth?\" It made her laugh. \"That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\\'t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?\"   Jon shrugged. \"Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.\"   There was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust, trying to get up and failing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. Bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. The men began to laugh.   \"Enough!\" Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet. \"Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.\" He looked around. \"Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?\"   Robb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. \"Gladly.\"   Joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik\\'s summons. His hair shone like spun gold. He looked bored. \"This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.\"   Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. \"You are children,\" he said derisively.   \"Robb may be a child,\" Joffrey said. \"I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword.\"   \"You got more swats than you gave, Joff,\" Robb said. \"Are you afraid?\"   Prince Joffrey looked at him. \"Oh, terrified,\" he said. \"You\\'re so much older.\" Some of the Lannister men laughed.   Jon looked down on the scene with a frown. \"Joffrey is truly a little shit,\" he told Arya.   Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. \"What are you suggesting?\" he asked the prince.   \"Live steel.\"   \"Done,\" Robb shot back. \"You\\'ll be sorry!\"   The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb\\'s shoulder to quiet him. \"Live steel is too dangerous. I will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.\"   Joffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, pushed forward in front of the prince. \"This is your prince. Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?\"  \"Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.\"   \"Are you training women here?\" the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a bull.   \"I am training knights,\" Ser Rodrik said pointedly. \"They will have steel when they are ready. When they are of an age.\"   The burned man looked at Robb. \"How old are you, boy?\"   \"Fourteen,\" Robb said.   \"I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.\"   Arya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. \"Let me do it. I can beat him.\"   \"Beat him with a tourney blade, then,\" Ser Rodrik said.   Joffrey shrugged. \"Come and see me when you\\'re older, Stark. If you\\'re not too old.\" There was laughter from the Lannister men.   Robb\\'s curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robb\\'s arm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay.   Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. \"Come, Tommen,\" he said. \"The hour of play is done. Leave the children to their frolics.\"   That brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodrik\\'s face was beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away.   Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \"The show is done,\" he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \"You had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. You\\'ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\"   Arya didn\\'t think it was funny. \"I hate needlework!\" she said with passion. \"It\\'s not fair!\"   \"Nothing is fair,\" Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya was not coming.   Reluctantly she turned in the other direction.   It was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn\\'t Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was Septa Mordane and her mother.',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 70.      The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch. \"Easy, sweet lady,\" he said in a soft voice, quieting her with a touch. Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy. \"Ghost,\" he called softly, \"to me.\" And the wolf was there, eyes like embers.   \"Jon, please. You must not do this.\"   He mounted, the reins in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night. Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over his shoulder. He threw a giant\\'s shadow, immense and black. \"Get out of my way, Sam.\"   \"Jon, you can\\'t,\" Sam said. \"I won\\'t let you.\"   \"I would sooner not hurt you,\" Jon told him. \"Move aside, Sam, or I\\'ll ride you down.\"   \"You won\\'t. You have to listen to me. Please . . . \"   Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door. For an instant Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening O of surprise. At the last moment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell. The mare leapt over him, out into the night.   Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head. Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side. Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south. No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables. He hoped Sam hadn\\'t hurt himself, falling like that. He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way. \"I warned him,\" Jon said aloud. \"It was nothing to do with him, anyway.\" He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers. They still pained him, but it felt good to have the wrappings off.   Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad. He needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone. On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than deception. It was not as though they would not guess where he was going.   The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall . . . if Sam Tarly did not betray him. The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother. If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King\\'s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep.   When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear\\'s breakfast from the kitchen, they\\'d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him. Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he fled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son\\'s disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust, but it couldn\\'t be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were betraying someone.   Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had it easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods\\' will and help sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak.   When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk. He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through. There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown.   He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he\\'d need to steal them. He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak. His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail. Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken. A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for him. Once Maester Aemon\\'s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven. Not even at Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense. He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to call there at all.   Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind\\'s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father\\'s solar, the turret room where he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage\\'s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool.   But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father\\'s son, and Robb\\'s brother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont. Nor was he Aemon Targaryen. Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but that was him. Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true. Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well.   Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials. He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life - however long that might be - he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man\\'s hand be raised against him. But it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother\\'s side and help avenge his father.   He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair. Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised. He tried to imagine the look on Robb\\'s face when he revealed himself. His brother would shake his head and smile, and he\\'d say . . . he\\'d say . . .   He could not see the smile. Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they\\'d found the direwolves. \"You said the words,\" Lord Eddard had told him. \"You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new.\" Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump. Bran\\'s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand. He remembered the look on Father\\'s face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet.   He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger. Would it have been any different? It must, surely, surely . . . and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty. He had to, or else . . .   It did not bear thinking about. Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the reins. Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts. Jon was not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father\\'s killers. He was no true Stark, had never been one . . . but he could die like one. Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three.   Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from his mouth. Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed. The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight. He vanished behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace.   Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road: Mole\\'s Town. A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule\\'s raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still. Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden slats, but only a few.   Mole\\'s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he\\'d heard men call the whores \"buried treasures.\" He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.   Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again. By then both he and the mare were damp with sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching. A bank of melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form small shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his hands together, cupping the runoff between his fingers. The snowmelt was icy cold. He drank, and splashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled. His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, and his head was pounding too. I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I feel so bad?   The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone. That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck. Jon wondered what had gotten into him. Was he in such a great rush to die?   Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up. His mare whinnied nervously. Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth. \"Ghost!\" he shouted. \"Ghost, to me.\" The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight.   Frowning, Jon continued on his way. He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry. Ghost did not appear. Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned about his missing wolf. \"Ghost,\" he called again. \"Where are you? To me! Ghost!\" Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown direwolf, unless . . . no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling.   He should eat, he decided. Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up. There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept. In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple. He\\'d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he\\'d filched from the kitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow. After it was gone he\\'d need to hunt, and that would slow him.   Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad. He kept the apple for last. It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart and juicy. He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, and from the north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare. Could he outrun them? No, they were too close, they\\'d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black . . .   He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels. \"Ouiet now,\" he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches. If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by. Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole\\'s Town, farmers on their way to their fields, although what they were doing out in the middle of the night . . .  He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad. From the sound, there were five or six of them at the least. Their voices drifted through the trees.   \" . . . certain he came this way?\"   \"We can\\'t be certain.\"   \"He could have ridden east, for all you know. Or left the road to cut through the woods. That\\'s what I\\'d do.\"   \"In the dark? Stupid. If you didn\\'t fall off your horse and break your neck, you\\'d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.\"   \"I would not.\" Grenn sounded peeved. \"I\\'d just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.\"   \"What if the sky was cloudy?\" Pyp asked.   \"Then I wouldn\\'t go.\"   Another voice broke in. \"You know where I\\'d be if it was me? I\\'d be in Mole\\'s Town, digging for buried treasure.\" Toad\\'s shrill laughter boomed through the trees. Jon\\'s mare snorted.   \"Keep quiet, all of you,\" Haider said. \"I thought I heard something .\"   \"Where? I didn\\'t hear anything.\" The horses stopped.   \"You can\\'t hear yourself fart.\"   \"I can too,\" Grenn insisted.   \"Quiet!\"   They all fell silent, listening. Jon found himself holding his breath. Sam, he thought. He hadn\\'t gone to the Old Bear, but he hadn\\'t gone to bed either, he\\'d woken the other boys. Damn them all. Come dawn, if they were not in their beds, they\\'d be named deserters too. What did they think they were doing?   The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on. From where Jon crouched, he could see the legs of their horses through the branches. Finally Pyp spoke up. \"What did you hear?\"   \"I don\\'t know,\" Haider admitted. \"A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but . . . \"   \"There\\'s nothing here.\"   Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees. Leaves rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly that Jon\\'s mare started and gave a whinny. \"There!\" Halder shouted.   \"I heard it too!\"   \"Traitor,\" Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle. He turned the mare\\'s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet.   \"Jon!\" Pyp shouted after him.   \"Pull up,\" Grenn said. \"You can\\'t outrun us all.\"   Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword. \"Get back. I don\\'t wish to hurt you, but I will if I have to.\"   \"One against seven?\" Halder gave a signal. The boys spread out, surrounding him.   \"What do you want with me?\" Jon demanded.   \"We want to take you back where you belong,\" Pyp said.   \"I belong with my brother.\"   \"We\\'re your brothers now,\" Grenn said.   \"They\\'ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,\" Toad put in with a nervous laugh. \"This is so stupid, it\\'s like something the Aurochs would do.\"   \"I would not,\" Grenn said. \"I\\'m no oathbreaker. I said the words and I meant them.\"   \"So did I,\" Jon told them. \"Don\\'t you understand? They murdered my father. It\\'s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands - \"   \"We know,\" said Pyp solemnly. \"Sam told us everything.\"   \"We\\'re sorry about your father,\" Grenn said, \"but it doesn\\'t matter. Once you say the words, you can\\'t leave, no matter what.\"   \"I have to,\" Jon said fervently.   \"You said the words,\" Pyp reminded him. \"Now my watch begins, you said it. It shall not end until my death.\"   \"I shall live and die at my post,\" Grenn added, nodding.   \"You don\\'t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do.\" He was angry now. Why couldn\\'t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder.   \"I am the sword in the darkness,\" Halder intoned.   \"The watcher on the walls,\" piped Toad.   Jon cursed them all to their faces. They took no notice. Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting, \"I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.\"   \"Stay back,\" Jon warned him, brandishing his sword. \"I mean it, Pyp.\" They weren\\'t even wearing armor, he could cut them to pieces if he had to.   Matthar had circled behind him. He joined the chorus. \"I pledge my life and honor to the Night\\'s Watch.\"   Jon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle. The boys were all around him now, closing from every side.   \"For this night . . . \" Halder trotted in from the left.   \" . . . and all the nights to come,\" finished Pyp. He reached over for Jon\\'s reins. \"So here are your choices. Kill me, or come back with me.\"   Jon lifted his sword . . . and lowered it, helpless. \"Damn you,\" he said. \"Damn you all.\"   \"Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you\\'ll ride back peaceful?\" asked Halder.   \"I won\\'t run, if that\\'s what you mean.\" Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at him. \"Small help you were,\" he said. The deep red eyes looked at him knowingly.   \"We had best hurry,\" Pyp said. \"If we\\'re not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all our heads.\"   Of the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little. It seemed shorter than the journey south, perhaps because his mind was elsewhere. Pyp set the pace, galloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into another gallop. Mole\\'s Town came and went, the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished. They made good time. Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall. It did not seem like home this time.   They could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay. The war would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day and night. He would bide his time, make them think he was content to remain here . . . and then, when they had grown lax, he would be off again. Next time he would avoid the kingsroad. He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way to the sea, a longer route but a safer one. Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over the high passes. That was the wildling\\'s way, hard and perilous, but at least no one wouid follow him. He wouldn\\'t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad.   Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of hay, too anxious to sleep. He rose and brushed himself off. \"I . . . I\\'m glad they found you, Jon.\"   \"I\\'m not,\" Jon said, dismounting.   Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust. \"Give us a hand bedding down the horses, Sam,\" the small boy said. \"We have a long day before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.\"   When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn. Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear\\'s breakfast. Today it was three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums. Jon carried the food back to the King\\'s Tower. He found Mormont at the window seat, writing. His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, muttering, \"Corn, corn, corn.\" The bird shrieked when Jon entered. \"Put the food on the table,\" the Old Bear said, glancing up. \"I\\'ll have some beer.\"   Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a horn. Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon crushed it in his fist. The juice trickled through his fingers. Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth.   \"Doubtless you loved your father,\" Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn. \"The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember when I told you that?\"   \"I remember,\" Jon said sullenly. He did not care to talk of his father\\'s death, not even to Mormont.   \"See that you never forget it. The hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Fetch me my plate. Is it ham again? So be it. You look weary. Was your moonlight ride so tiring?\"   Jon\\'s throat was dry. \"You know?\"   \"Know,\" the raven echoed from Mormont\\'s shoulder. \"Know.\"   The Old Bear snorted. \"Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night\\'s Watch because I\\'m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you\\'d go. I told him you\\'d be back. I know my men . . . and my boys too. Honor set you on the kingsroad . . . and honor brought you back.\"   \"My friends brought me back,\" Jon said.   \"Did I say it was your honor?\" Mormont inspected his plate.   \"They killed my father. Did you expect me to do nothing?\"   \"If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did.\" Mormont tried a plum, spit out the pit. \"I ordered a watch kept over you., You were seen leaving. If your brothers had not fetched you back, you would have been taken along the way, and not by friends. Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven. Do you?\"   \"No.\" Jon felt like a fool.   \"Pity, we could use a horse like that.\"   Jon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the least. \"I know the penalty for desertion, my lord. I\\'m not afraid to die.\"   \"Die!\" the raven cried.   \"Nor live, I hope,\" Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird. \"You have not deserted - yet. Here you stand. If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole\\'s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?\"   Jon kept silent.   \"I thought so.\" Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg. \"Your father is dead, lad. Do you think you can bring him back?\"   \"No,\" he answered, sullen.   \"Good,\" Mormont said. \"We\\'ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it\\'s not something I care to see again.\" He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth. \"Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him. Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you\\'ll find in all the Night\\'s Watch. Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?\"   Jon had no answer for him. The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell. Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke.   The Old Bear sighed. \"You are not the only one touched by this war. Like as not, my sister is marching in your brother\\'s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men\\'s mail. Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters.\" Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched. \"Or perhaps it does. Be that as it may, I\\'d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don\\'t see me running off. I said the words, just as you did. My place is here . . . where is yours, boy?\"   I have no place, Jon wanted to say, I\\'m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not even a father. The words would not come. \"I don\\'t know.\"   \"I do,\" said Lord Commander Mormont. \"The cold winds are rising, Snow. Beyond the Wall, the shadows lengthen. Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk, streaming south and east toward the sea, and mammoths as well. He says one of his men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch. Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn. Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new, secret stronghold he\\'s found, to what end the gods only know. Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we\\'ve lost this past year?\"   \"Ben Jen,\" the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak. \"Ben Jen. Ben Jen.\"   \"No,\" Jon said. There had been others. Too many.   \"Do you think your brother\\'s war is more important than ours?\" the old man barked.   Jon chewed his lip. The raven flapped its wings at him. \"War, war, war, war,\" it sang.   \"It\\'s not,\" Mormont told him. \"Gods save us, boy, you\\'re not blind and you\\'re not stupid. When dead men come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?\"   \"No.\" Jon had not thought of it that way.   \"Your lord father sent you to us, Jon. Why, who can say?\"   \"Why? Why? Why?\" the raven called.   \"All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks. The First Men built the Wall, and it\\'s said they remember things otherwise forgotten. And that beast of yours . . . he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps. Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I\\'m not.\" Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger. \"I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall.\"   His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon\\'s back. \"Beyond the Wall?\"   \"You heard me. I mean to find Ben Stark, alive or dead.\" He chewed and swallowed. \"I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds. We must know what is happening. This time the Night\\'s Watch will ride in force, against the King-beyond-the-Wall, the Others, and anything else that may be out there. I mean to command them myself.\" He pointed his dagger at Jon\\'s chest. \"By custom, the Lord Commander\\'s steward is his squire as well . . . but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you\\'ve run off again. So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now. Are you a brother of the Night\\'s Watch . . . or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?\"   Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath. Forgive me, Father. Robb, Arya, Bran . . . forgive me, I cannot help you. He has the truth of it. This is my place. \"I am . . . yours, my lord. Your man. I swear it. I will not run again.\"   The Old Bear snorted. \"Good. Now go put on your sword.\"',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 71.       It seemed a thousand years ago that Catelyn Stark had carried her infant son out of Riverrun, crossing the Tumblestone in a small boat to begin their journey north to Winterfell. And it was across the Tumblestone that they came home now, though the boy wore plate and mail in place of swaddling clothes.   Robb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, his hand resting on his direwolf s head as the rowers pulled at their oars. Theon Greyjoy was with him. Her uncle Brynden would come behind in the second boat, with the Greatjon and Lord Karstark.   Catelyn took a place toward the stern. They shot down the Tumblestone, letting the strong current push them past the looming WheelTower. The splash and rumble of the great waterwheel within was a sound from her girlhood that brought a sad smile to Catelyn\\'s face. From the sandstone walls of the castle, soldiers and servants shouted down her name, and Robb\\'s, and \"Winterfell!\" From every rampart waved the banner of House Tully: a leaping trout, silver, against a rippling blue-and-red field. It was a stirring sight, yet it did not lift her heart. She wondered if indeed her heart would ever lift again. Oh, Ned . . .   Below the WheelTower, they made a wide turn and knifed through the churning water. The men put their backs into it. The wide arch of the Water Gate came into view, and she heard the creak of heavy chains as the great iron portcullis was winched upward. It rose slowly as they approached, and Catelyn saw that the lower half of it was red with rust. The bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as they passed underneath, the barbed spikes mere inches above their heads. Catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered how deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it ought to be replaced. Thoughts like that were seldom far from her mind these days.   They passed beneath the arch and under the walls, moving from sunlight to shadow and back into sunlight. Boats large and small were tied up all around them, secured to iron rings set in the stone. Her father\\'s guards waited on the water stair with her brother. Ser Edmure Tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery beard. His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle, his blue-and-red cloak stained by blood and smoke. At his side stood the Lord Tytos Blackwood, a hard pike of a man with close-cropped salt-and-pepper whiskers and a hook nose. His bright yellow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf patterns, and a cloak sewn from raven feathers draped his thin shoulders. It had been Lord Tytos who led the sortie that plucked her brother from the Lannister camp.   \"Bring them in,\" Ser Edmure commanded. Three men scrambled down the stairs knee-deep in the water and pulled the boat close with long hooks. When Grey Wind bounded out, one of them dropped his pole and lurched back, stumbling and sitting down abruptly in the river. The others laughed, and the man got a sheepish look on his face. Theon Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn by the waist, setting her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots.   Edmure came down the steps to embrace her. \"Sweet sister,\" he murmured hoarsely. He had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles, but he was not smiling now. He looked worn and tired, battered by battle and haggard from strain. His neck was bandaged where he had taken a wound. Catelyn hugged him fiercely.   \"Your grief is mine, Cat,\" he said when they broke apart. \"When we heard about Lord Eddard . . . the Lannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your vengeance.\"   \"Will that bring Ned back to me?\" she said sharply. The wound was still too fresh for softer words. She could not think about Ned now. She would not. It would not do. She had to be strong. \"All that will keep. I must see Father.\"   \"He awaits you in his solar,\" Edmure said.   \"Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady,\" her father\\'s steward explained. When had that good man grown so old and grey? \"He instructed me to bring you to him at once.\"   \"I\\'ll take her.\" Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her favor. The massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them. As they pushed through a door between two guardsmen in fish-crest helms, she asked, \"How bad is he?\" dreading the answer even as she said the words.   Edmure\\'s look was somber. \"He will not be with us long, the maesters say. The pain is . . . constant, and grievous.\"   A blind rage filled her, a rage at all the world; at her brother Edmure and her sister Lysa, at the Lannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and her father and the monstrous gods who would take them both away from her. \"You should have told me,\" she said. \"You should have sent word as soon as you knew.\"   \"He forbade it. He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying. With the realm so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he was . . . \"   \" . . . they might attack?\" Catelyn finished, hard. It was your doing, yours, a voice whispered inside her. If you had not taken it upon yourself to seize the dwarf . . .   They climbed the spiral stair in silence.   The keep was three-sided, like Riverrun itself, and Lord Hoster\\'s solar was triangular as well, with a stone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of some great sandstone ship. From there the lord of the castle could look down on his walls and battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met. They had moved her father\\'s bed out onto the balcony. \"He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers,\" Edmure explained. \"Father, see who I\\'ve brought. Cat has come to see you . . . \"   Hoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as he grew older. Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones. Even his face sagged. The last time Catelyn had seen him, his hair and beard had been brown, well streaked with grey. Now they had gone white as snow.   His eyes opened to the sound of Edmure\\'s voice. \"Little cat,\" he murmured in a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain. \"My little cat.\" A tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers. \"I watched for you . . . \"   \"I shall leave you to talk,\" her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on the brow before he withdrew.   Catelyn knelt and took her father\\'s hand in hers. It was a big hand, but fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from it. \"You should have told me,\" she said. \"A rider, a raven . . . \"   \"Riders are taken, questioned,\" he answered. \"Ravens are brought down . . . \" A spasm of pain took him, and his fingers clutched hers hard. \"The crabs are in my belly . . . pinching, always pinching. Day and night. They have fierce claws, the crabs. Maester Vyman makes me dreamwine, milk of the poppy . . . I sleep a lot . . . but I wanted to be awake to see you, when you came. I was afraid . . . when the Lannisters took your brother, the camps all around us . . . was afraid I would go, before I could see you again . . . I was afraid . . . \"   \"I\\'m here, Father,\" she said. \"With Robb, my son. He\\'ll want to see you too.\"   \"Your boy,\" he whispered. \"He had my eyes, I remember . . . \"   \"He did, and does. And we\\'ve brought you Jaime Lannister, in irons. Riverrun is free again, Father.\"   Lord Hoster smiled. \"I saw. Last night, when it began, I told them . . . had to see. They carried me to the gatehouse . . . watched from the battlements. Ah, that was beautiful . . . the torches came in a wave, I could hear the cries floating across the river . . . sweet cries . . . when that siege tower went up, gods . . . would have died then, and glad, if only I could have seen you children first. Was it your boy who did it? Was it your Robb?\"   \"Yes,\" Catelyn said, fiercely proud. \"It was Robb . . . and Brynden. Your brother is here as well, my lord.\"   \"Him.\" Her father\\'s voice was a faint whisper. \"The Blackfish . . . came back? From the Vale?\"   \"Yes.\"   \"And Lysa?\" A cool wind moved through his thin white hair. \"Gods be good, your sister . . . did she come as well?\"   He sounded so full of hope and yearning that it was hard to tell the truth. \"No. I\\'m sorry . . . \"   \"Oh.\" His face fell, and some light went out of his eyes. \"I\\'d hoped I would have liked to see her, before . . . \"   \"She\\'s with her son, in the Eyrie.\"   Lord Hoster gave a weary nod. \"Lord Robert now, poor Arryn\\'s gone . . . I remember . . . why did she not come with you?\"   \"She is frightened, my lord. In the Eyrie she feels safe.\" She kissed his wrinkled brow. \"Robb will be waiting. Will you see him? And Brynden?\"   \"Your son,\" he whispered. \"Yes. Cat\\'s child . . . he had my eyes, I remember. When he was born. Bring him . . . yes.\"   \"And your brother?\"   Her father glanced out over the rivers. \"Blackfish,\" he said. \"Has he wed yet? Taken some . . . girl to wife?\"   Even on his deathbed, Catelyn thought sadly. \"He has not wed. You know that, Father. Nor will he ever.\"   \"I told him . . . commanded him. Marry! I was his lord. He knows. My right, to make his match. A good match. A Redwyne. Old House. Sweet girl, pretty . . . freckles . . . Bethany, yes. Poor child. Still waiting. Yes. Still . . . \"   \"Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago,\" Catelyn reminded him. \"She has three children by him.\"   \"Even so,\" Lord Hoster muttered. \"Even so. Spit on the girl. The Redwynes. Spit on me. His lord, his brother . . . that Blackfish. I had other offers. Lord Bracken\\'s girl. Walder Frey . . . any of three, he said . . . Has he wed? Anyone? Anyone?\"   \"No one,\" Catelyn said, \"yet he has come many leagues to see you, fighting his way back to Riverrun. I would not be here now, if Ser Brynden had not helped us.\"   \"He was ever a warrior,\" her father husked. \"That he could do. Knight of the Gate, yes.\" He leaned back and closed his eyes, inutterably weary. \"Send him. Later. I\\'ll sleep now. Too sick to fight. Send him up later, the Blackfish . . . \"   Catelyn kissed him gently, smoothed his hair, and left him there in the shade of his keep, with his rivers flowing beneath. He was asleep before she left the solar.   When she returned to the lower bailey, Ser Brynden Tully stood on the water stairs with wet boots, talking with the captain of Riverrun\\'s guards. He came to her at once. \"Is he - \"   \"Dying,\" she said. \"As we feared.\"   Her uncle\\'s craggy face showed his pain plain. He ran his fingers through his thick grey hair. \"Will he see me?\"   She nodded. \"He says he is too sick to fight.\"   Brynden Blackfish chuckled. \"I am too old a soldier to believe that. Hoster will be chiding me about the Redwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre, damn his bones.\"   Catelyn smiled, knowing it was true. \"I do not see Robb.\"   \"He went with Greyjoy to the hall, I believe.\"   Theon Greyjoy was seated on a bench in Riverrun\\'s Great Hall, enjoying a horn of ale and regaling her father\\'s garrison with an account of the slaughter in the Whispering Wood. \"Some tried to flee, but we\\'d pinched the valley shut at both ends, and we rode out of the darkness with sword and lance. The Lannisters must have thought the Others themselves were on them when that wolf of Robb\\'s got in among them. I saw him tear one man\\'s arm from his shoulder, and their horses went mad at the scent of him. I couldn\\'t tell you how many men were thrown - \"   \"Theon,\" she interrupted, \"where might I find my son?\"   \"Lord Robb went to visit the godswood, my lady.\"   It was what Ned would have done. He is his father\\'s son as much as mine, I must remember. Oh, gods, Ned . . .   She found Robb beneath the green canopy of leaves, surrounded by tall redwoods and great old elms, kneeling before the heart tree, a slender weirwood with a face more sad than fierce. His longsword was before him, the point thrust in the earth, his gloved hands clasped around the hilt. Around him others knelt: Greatjon Umber, Rickard Karstark, Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and more. Even Tytos Blackwood was among them, the great raven cloak fanned out behind him. These are the ones who keep the old gods, she realized. She asked herself what gods she kept these days, and could not find an answer.   It would not do to disturb them at their prayers. The gods must have their due . . . even cruel gods who would take Ned from her, and her lord father as well. So Catelyn waited. The river wind moved through the high branches, and she could see the Wheel Tower to her right, ivy crawling up its side . As she stood there, all the memories came flooding back to her. Her father had taught her to ride amongst these trees, and that was the elm that Edmure had fallen from when he broke his arm, and over there, beneath that bower, she and Lysa had played at kissing with Petyr.   She had not thought of that in years. How young they all had been - she no older than Sansa, Lysa younger than Arya, and Petyr younger still, yet eager. The girls had traded him between them, serious and giggling by turns. It came back to her so vividly she could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her shoulders and taste the mint on his breath. There was always mint growing in the godswood, and Petyr had liked to chew it. He had been such a bold little boy, always in trouble. \"He tried to put his tongue in my mouth,\" Catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward, when they were alone. \"He did with me too,\" Lysa had whispered, shy and breathless. \"I liked it.\"   Robb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword, and Catelyn found herself wondering whether her son had ever kissed a girl in the godswood. Surely he must have. She had seen Jeyne Poole giving him moist-eyed glances, and some of the serving girls, even ones as old as eighteen . . . he had ridden in battle and killed men with a sword, surely he had been kissed. There were tears in her eyes. She wiped them away angrily.   \"Mother,\" Robb said when he saw her standing there. \"We must call a council. There are things to be decided.\"   \"Your grandfather would like to see you,\" she said. \"Robb, he\\'s very sick.\"   \"Ser Edmure told me. I am sorry, Mother . . . for Lord Hoster and for you. Yet first we must meet. We\\'ve had word from the south. Renly Baratheon has claimed his brother\\'s crown.\"   \"Renly?\" she said, shocked. \"I had thought, surely it would be Lord Stannis . . . \"   \"So did we all, my lady,\" Galbart Glover said.   The war council convened in the Great Hall, at four long trestle tables arranged in a broken square. Lord Hoster was too weak to attend, asleep on his balcony, dreaming of the sun on the rivers of his youth. Edmure sat in the high seat of the Tullys, with Brynden Blackfish at his side, and his father\\'s bannermen arrayed to right and left and along the side tables. Word of the victory at Riverrun had spread to the fugitive lords of the Trident, drawing them back. Karyl Vance came in, a lord now, his father dead beneath the Golden Tooth. Ser Marq Piper was with him, and they brought a Darry, Ser Raymun\\'s son, a lad no older than Bran. Lord Jonos Bracken arrived from the ruins of Stone Hedge, glowering and blustering, and took a seat as far from Tytos Blackwood as the tables would permit.  The northern lords sat opposite, with Catelyn and Robb facing her brother across the tables. They were fewer. The Greatjon sat at Robb\\'s left hand, and then Theon Greyjoy; Galbart Glover and Lady Mormont were to the right of Catelyn. Lord Rickard Karstark, gaunt and hollow-eyed in his grief, took his seat like a man in a nightmare, his long beard uncombed and unwashed. He had left two sons dead in the Whispering Wood, and there was no word of the third, his eldest, who had led the Karstark spears against Tywin Lannister on the Green Fork.   The arguing raged on late into the night. Each lord had a right to speak, and speak they did . . . and shout, and curse, and reason, and cajole, and jest, and bargain, and slam tankards on the table, and threaten, and walk out, and return sullen or smiling. Catelyn sat and listened to it all.   Roose Bolton had re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the mouth of the causeway. Ser Helman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins. Lord Tywin\\'s army had crossed the Trident, and was making for Harrenhal. And there were two kings in the realm. Two kings, and no agreement.   Many of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet Lord Tywin and end Lannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a strike west at Casterly Rock instead. Still others counseled patience. Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let them bide their time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops. Lord Blackwood would have none of it. They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton\\'s army down as well. What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move south to join their might to his.   \"Renly is not the king,\" Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. Like his father, he knew how to listen.   \"You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,\" Galbart Glover said. \"He put your father to death.\"   \"That makes him evil,\" Robb replied. \"I do not know that it makes Renly king. Joffrey is still Robert\\'s eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother. Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.\"   \"Tommen is no less a Lannister,\" Ser Marq Piper snapped.   \"As you say,\" said Robb, troubled. \"Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly? He\\'s Robert\\'s younger brother. Bran can\\'t be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly can\\'t be king before Lord Stannis.\"   Lady Mormont agreed. \"Lord Stannis has the better claim.\"   \"Renly is crowned,\" said Marq Piper. \"Highgarden and Storm\\'s End support his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him. Six, if the Arryns bestir themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, within the year, we will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, all of them! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly. What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?\"   \"The right,\" said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it.   \"So you mean us to declare for Stannis?\" asked Edmure.   \"I don\\'t know,\" said Robb. \"I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer. The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we will be traitors.\"   \"My lord father would urge caution,\" aged Ser Stevron said, with the weaselly smile of a Frey. \"Wait, let these two kings play their game of thrones. When they are done fighting, we can bend our knees to the victor, or oppose him, as we choose. With Renly arming, likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce . . . and the safe return of his son. Noble lords, allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransoms . . . \"   A roar of outrage drowned out his voice. \"Craven!\" the Greatjon thundered. \"Begging for a truce will make us seem weak,\" declared Lady Mormont. \"Ransoms be damned, we must not give up the Kingslayer,\" shouted Rickard Karstark.   \"Why not a peace?\" Catelyn asked.   The lords looked at her, but it was Robb\\'s eyes she felt, his and his alone. \"My lady, they murdered my lord father, your husband,\" he said grimly. He unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before him, the bright steel on the rough wood. \"This is the only peace I have for Lannisters.\"   The Greatjon bellowed his approval, and other men added their voices, shouting and drawing swords and pounding their fists on the table. Catelyn waited until they had quieted. \"My lords,\" she said then, \"Lord Eddard was your liege, but I shared his bed and bore his children. Do you think I love him any less than you?\" Her voice almost broke with her grief, but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself. \"Robb, if that sword could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side once more . . . but he is gone, and hundred Whispering Woods will not change that. Ned is gone, and Daryn Hornwood, and Lord Karstark\\'s valiant sons, and many other good men besides, and none of them will return to us. Must we have more deaths still?\"   \"You are a woman, my lady,\" the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice. \"Women do not understand these things.\"   \"You are the gentle sex,\" said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on his face. \"A man has a need for vengeance.\"   \"Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord Karstark, and you would see how gentle a woman can be,\" Catelyn replied. \"Perhaps I do not understand tactics and strategy . . . but I understand futility. We went to war when Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands, and Ned was a prisoner, falsely accused of treason. We fought to defend ourselves, and to win my lord\\'s freedom.   \"Well, the one is done, and the other forever beyond our reach. I will mourn for Ned until the end of my days, but I must think of the living. I want my daughters back, and the queen holds them still. If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks, I will call that a bargain and thank the gods. I want you safe, Robb, ruling at Winterfell from your father\\'s seat. I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son. I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my lords, and weep for my husband.\"   The hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking.   \"Peace,\" said her uncle Brynden. \"Peace is sweet, my lady . . . but on what terms? It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow.\"   \"What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for, if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but their bones?\" asked Rickard Karstark.   \"Aye,\" said Lord Bracken. \"Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields, slaughtered my smallfolk, and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin. Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him? What have we fought for, if we are to put all back as it was before?\"   Lord Blackwood agreed, to Catelyn\\'s surprise and dismay. \"And if we do make peace with King Joffrey, are we not then traitors to King Renly? What if the stag should prevail against the lion, where would that leave us?\"   \"Whatever you may decide for yourselves, I shall never call a Lannister my king,\" declared Marq Piper.   \"Nor I!\" yelled the little Darry boy. \"I never will!\"   Again the shouting began. Catelyn sat despairing. She had come so close, she thought. They had almost listened, almost . . . but the moment was gone. There would be no peace, no chance to heal, no safety. She looked at her son, watched him as he listened to the lords debate, frowning, troubled, yet wedded to his war. He had pledged himself to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, but she saw his true bride plain before her now: the sword he had laid on the table.   Catelyn was thinking of her girls, wondering if she would ever see them again, when the Greatjon lurched to his feet.   \"MY LORDS!\" he shouted, his voice booming off the rafters. \"Here is what I say to these two kings!\" He spat. \" Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne? What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, I\\'ve had a bellyful of them.\" He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword. \"Why shouldn\\'t we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!\" He pointed at Robb with the blade. \"There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m\\'lords,\" he thundered. \"The King in the North!\"   And he knelt, and laid his sword at her son\\'s feet.   \"I\\'ll have peace on those terms,\" Lord Karstark said. \"They can keep their red castle and their iron chair as well.\" He eased his longsword from its scabbard. \"The King in the North!\" he said, kneeling beside the Greatjon.   Maege Mormont stood. \"The King of Winter!\" she declared, and laid her spiked mace beside the swords. And the river lords were rising too, Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell, yet Catelyn watched them rise and draw their blades, bending their knees and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years, since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdoms one . . . yet now were heard again, ringing from the timbers of her father\\'s hall:   \"The King in the North!\"   \"The King in the North!\"   \"THE KING IN THE NORTH!\"',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 72.      The land was red and dead and parched, and good wood was hard to come by. Her foragers returned with gnarled cottonwoods, purple brush, sheaves of brown grass. They took the two straightest trees, hacked the limbs and branches from them, skinned off their bark, and split them, laying the logs in a square. Its center they filled with straw, brush, bark shavings, and bundles of dry grass. Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them; he was not the equal of Khal Drogo\\'s red, but few horses were. In the center of the square, Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes.   Bound hand and foot, Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes. \"It is not enough to kill a horse,\" she told Dany. \"By itself, the blood is nothing. You do not have the words to make a spell, nor the wisdom to find them. Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children? You call me maegi as if it were a curse, but all it means is wise. You are a child, with a child\\'s ignorance. Whatever you mean to do, it will not work. Loose me from these bonds and I will help you.\"   \"I am tired of the maegi\\'s braying,\" Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife kept silent.   Over the carcass of the horse, they built a platform of hewn logs; trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater, and the thickest straightest branches they could find. They laid the wood east to west, from sunrise to sunset. On the platform they piled Khal Drogo\\'s treasures: his great tent, his painted vests, his saddles and harness, the whip his father had given him when he came to manhood, the arakh he had used to slay Khal Ogo and his son, a mighty dragonbone bow. Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo\\'s bloodriders had given Dany for bride gifts as well, but she forbade it. \"Those are mine,\" she told him, \"and I mean to keep them.\" Another layer of brush was piled about the khal\\'s treasures, and bundles of dried grass scattered over them.   Ser Jorah Mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith. \"Princess . . . \" he began.   \"Why do you call me that?\" Dany challenged him. \"My brother Viserys was your king, was he not?\"   \"He was, my lady.\"   \"Viserys is dead. I am his heir, the last blood of House Targaryen. Whatever was his is mine now.\"   \"My . . . queen,\" Ser Jorah said, going to one knee. \"My sword that was his is yours, Dacnerys. And my heart as well, that never belonged to your brother. I am only a knight, and I have nothing to offer you but exile, but I beg you, hear me. Let Khal Drogo go. You shall not be alone. I promise you, no man shall take you to Vaes Dothrak unless you wish to go. You need not join the dosh khaleen. Come east with me. Yi Ti, Qarth, the JadeSea, Asshai by the Shadow. We will see all the wonders yet unseen, and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us. Please, Khaleesi. I know what you intend. Do not. Do not.\"   \"I must,\" Dany told him. She touched his face, fondly, sadly. \"You do not understand.\"   \"I understand that you loved him,\" Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair. \"I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her. You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo\\'s pyre. I will not watch you burn.\"   \"Is that what you fear?\" Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead. \"I am not such a child as that, sweet ser.\"   \"You do not mean to die with him? You swear it, my queen?\"   \"I swear it,\" she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers.   The third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a finger, and covered with dry leaves and twigs. They laid them north to south, from ice to fire, and piled them high with soft cushions and sleeping silks. The sun had begun to lower toward the west by the time they were done. Dany called the Dothraki around her. Fewer than a hundred were left. How many had Aegon started with? she wondered. It did not matter.   \"You will be my khalasar,\" she told them. \"I see the faces of slaves. I free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one shall harm you. If you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.\" The black eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. \"I see the children, women, the wrinkled faces of the aged. I was a child yesterday. Today I am a woman. Tomorrow I will be old. To each of you I say, give me your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for you.\" She turned to the three young warriors of her khas. \"Jhogo, to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift, and name you ko, and ask your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.\"   Jhogo took the whip from her hands, but his face was confused. \"Khaleesi, \" he said hesitantly, \"this is not done. It would shame me, to be bloodrider to a woman.\"   \"Aggo,\" Dany called, paying no heed to Jhogo\\'s words. If I look back I am lost. \"To you I give the dragonbone bow that was my bride gift.\" It was double-curved, shiny black and exquisite, taller than she was. \"I name you ko, and ask your oath, that you should live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.\"  Aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes. \"I cannot say these words. Only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko.\"   \"Rakharo,\" Dany said, turning away from the refusal, \"you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift, with hilt and blade chased in gold. And you too I name my ko, and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.\"   \"You are khaleesi,\" Rakharo said, taking the arakh. \"I shall ride at your side to Vaes Dothrak beneath the Mother of Mountains, and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen. No more can I promise.\"   She nodded, as calmly as if she had not heard his answer, and turned to the last of her champions. \"Ser Jorah Mormont,\" she said, \"first and greatest of my knights, I have no bride gift to give you, but I swear to you, one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen, dragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel. And I would ask for your oath as well.\"   \"You have it, my queen,\" Ser Jorah said, kneeling to lay his sword at her feet. \"I vow to serve you, to obey you, to die for you if need be.\"   \"Whatever may come?\"   \"Whatever may come.\"   \"I shall hold you to that oath. I pray you never regret the giving of it.\" Dany lifted him to his feet. Stretching on her toes to reach his lips, she kissed the knight gently and said, \"You are the first of my Queensguard.\"   She could feel the eyes of the khalasar on her as she entered her tent. The Dothraki were muttering and giving her strange sideways looks from the corners of their dark almond eyes. They thought her mad, Dany realized. Perhaps she was. She would know soon enough. If I look back I am lost.   Her bath was scalding hot when Irri helped her into the tub, but Dany did not flinch or cry aloud. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Jhiqui had scented the water with the oils she had found in the market in Vaes Dothrak; the steam rose moist and fragrant. Doreah washed her hair and combed it out, working loose the mats and tangles. Irri scrubbed her back. Dany closed her eyes and let the smell and the warmth enfold her. She could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between her thighs. She shuddered when it entered her, and her pain and stiffness seemed to dissolve. She floated.   When she was clean, her handmaids helped her from the water. Irri and Jhiqui fanned her dry, while Doreah brushed her hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver down her back. They scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon; a touch on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts. The last dab was for her sex. Irri\\'s finger felt as light and cool as a lover\\'s kiss as it slid softly up between her lips.   Afterward, Dany sent them all away, so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his final ride into the night lands. She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair, running her fingers through it for the last time, feeling the weight of it, remembering the first time she had touched it, the night of their wedding ride. His hair had never been cut. How many men could die with their hair uncut? She buried her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils. He smelled like grass and warm earth, like smoke and se  n and horses. He smelled like Drogo. Forgive me, sun of my life, she thought. Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do. I paid the price, my star, but it was too high, too high . . .   Dany braided his hair and slid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his bells one by one. So many bells, gold and silver and bronze. Bells so his enemies would hear him coming and grow weak with fear. She dressed him in horsehair leggings and high boots, buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions about his waist. Over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest, old and faded, the one Drogo had loved best. For herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers, sandals that laced halfway up her legs, and a vest like Drogo\\'s.   The sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre. The Dothraki watched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the tent. Dany walked behind them . They laid him down on his cushions and silks, his head toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast.   \"Oil,\" she commanded, and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre, soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass, until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance. \"Bring my eggs,\" Dany commanded her handmaids. Something in her voice made them run.   Ser Jorah took her arm. \"My queen, Drogo will have no use for dragon\\'s eggs in the night lands. Better to sell them in Asshai. Sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the Free Cities. Sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all your days.\"   \"They were not given to me to sell,\" Dany told him.   She climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sun-and-stars. The black beside his heart, under his arm. The green beside his head, his braid coiled around it. The cream-and-gold down between his legs. When she kissed him for the last time, Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips.   As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. \"You are mad,\" the godswife said hoarsely.   \"Is it so far from madness to wisdom?\" Dany asked. \"Ser Jorah, take this maegi and bind her to the pyre.\"   \"To the . . . my queen, no, hear me . . . \"   \"Do as I say.\" Still he hesitated, until her anger flared. \"You swore to obey me, whatever might come. Rakharo, help him.\"   The godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo\\'s pyre and staked her down amidst his treasures. Dany poured the oil over the woman\\'s head herself. \"I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur,\" she said, \"for the lessons you have taught me.\"   \"You will not hear me scream,\" Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing.   \"I will,\" Dany said, \"but it is not your screams I want, only your life. I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.\" Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away, Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi\\'s flat black eyes; in its place was something that might have been fear. Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star.   When a horselord dies, his horse is slain with him, so he might ride proud into the night lands. The bodies are burned beneath the open sky, and the khal rises on his fiery steed to take his place among the stars. The more fiercely the man burned in life, the brighter his star will shine in the darkness.   Jhogo spied it first. \"There,\" he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon\\'s tail. She could not have asked for a stronger sign.   Dany took the torch from Aggo\\'s hand and thrust it between the logs. The oil took the fire at once, the brush and dried grass a heartbeat later. Tiny flames went darting up the wood like swift red mice, skating over the oil and leaping from bark to branch to leaf. A rising heat puffed at her face, soft and sudden as a lover\\'s breath, but in seconds it had grown too hot to bear. Dany stepped backward. The wood crackled, louder and louder. Mirri Maz Duur began to sing in a shrill, ululating voice. The flames whirled and writhed, racing each other up the platform. The dusk shimmered as the air itself seemed to liquefy from the heat. Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, shriller . . . then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and high and full of agony.   And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany\\'s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever.   She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur\\'s screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in her.   She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough. The flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, alive with heat. Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing. This is a wedding, too, she thought. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent. The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and children learn.   Another step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her br  sts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind her, but he did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered. The flames were so beautiful, the loveliest things she had ever seen, each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and orange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame; she saw fish and foxes and monsters, wolves and bright birds and flowering trees, each more beautiful than the last. She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame. Yes, my love, my sun-and-stars, yes, mount now, ride now.   Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her br  sts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing.   She heard a crack, the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved rock, pale and veined with gold, broken and smoking. The roaring filled the world, yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder.   Only death can pay for life.   And there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts. She heard the screams of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing. No, she wanted to shout to him, no, my good knight, do not fear for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of dragons, mother of dragons, don\\'t you see? Don\\'t you SEE? With a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down around her. Unafraid, Dany stepped forward into the firestorm, calling to her children.   The third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world.   When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion. She was naked, covered with soot, her clothes turned to ash, her beautiful hair all crisped away . . . yet she was unhurt.   The cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at her left breast, the green-and-bronze at the right. Her arms cradled them close. The black-and-scarlet beast was draped across her shoulders, its long sinuous neck coiled under her chin. When it saw Jorah, it raised its head and looked at him with eyes as red as coals.   Wordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her khas came up behind him. Jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet. \"Blood of my blood,\" he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking earth. \"Blood of my blood,\" she heard Aggo echo. \"Blood of my blood,\" Rakharo shouted.   And after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all the Dothraki, men and women and children, and Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now, today and tomorrow and forever, hers as they had never been Drogo\\'s.   As Daenerys Targaryen rose to her feet, her black hissed, pale smoke venting from its mouth and nostrils. The other two pulled away from her br  sts and added their voices to the call, translucent wings unfolding and stirring the air, and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night came alive with the music of dragons.   THE END ',\n",
       " 'Kapitel 8.      The hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queen\\'s funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the morrow they left for the south.   Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He thought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. He was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night\\'s Watch. That was almost as good as going south with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon.   For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at King\\'s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords.   Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another\\'s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.   Two of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, never quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the stories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn\\'t count anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached King\\'s Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.   Yet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but \"Hodor,\" the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit . . .   But it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn\\'t his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his father\\'s kennel and Bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks.   He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon\\'s wolf, the white one, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn\\'t white. He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.   Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn\\'t been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance.   He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. \"You stay here,\" he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall. \"Lie down. That\\'s right. Now stay - \"   The wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl.   Bran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. A strange chill went through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf howled. \"Quiet,\" he yelled. \"Sit down. Stay. You\\'re worse than Mother.\" The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight.   The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran\\'s second home. His mother often said that Bran could climb before he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true.   To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn\\'t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.   When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.   It taught him Winterfell\\'s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn\\'t know that, Bran was convinced.   His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told her that he wouldn\\'t, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep.   He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove.   As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. \"You\\'re not my son,\" he told Bran when they fetched him down, \"you\\'re a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you.\"   Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. Since his father would not forbid it, she turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not impressed. There were crows\\' nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.   Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran\\'s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, \"I\\'m not made of clay. And anyhow, I never fall.\"   Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him down. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his brothers, except that Bran always won. None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never saw him anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost like being invisible.   He liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between . He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. He liked the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the crows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all.   Most of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran\\'s secret place.   His favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for Bran and the crows.   He knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them.   The best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn\\'t hear you overhead. That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From there, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close. The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, and then the crows would come round to see if you\\'d brought any corn.   Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices. He was so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep had been empty all his life.   \"I do not like it,\" a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side. \"You should be the Hand.\"   \"Gods forbid,\" a man\\'s voice replied lazily. \"It\\'s not an honor I\\'d want. There\\'s far too much work involved.\"   Bran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. They might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by.   \"Don\\'t you see the danger this puts us in?\" the woman said. \"Robert loves the man like a brother.\"  \"Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion.\"   \"Don\\'t play the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is quite another. Robert will listen to Stark. Damn them both. I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would refuse him.\"   \"We ought to count ourselves fortunate,\" the man said. \"The king might as easily have named one of his brothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and I\\'ll sleep more easily by night.\"   They were talking about Father, Bran realized. He wanted to hear more. A few more feet . . . but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window.   \"We will have to watch him carefully,\" the woman said.   \"I would sooner watch you,\" the man said. He sounded bored. \"Come back here.\"   \"Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck,\" the woman said. \"Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why else would he leave the seat of his power?\"   \"A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across the book of history, to get away from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life.\"   \"His wife is Lady Arryn\\'s sister. It\\'s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.\"   Bran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches wide. He tried to lower himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach.   \"You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.\"   \"That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn\\'s bed.\"   \"If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King\\'s Landing.\"   \"When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I think not. She knew the boy\\'s life would be hostage to her silence. She may grow bolder now that he\\'s safe atop the Eyrie.\"   \"Mothers.\" The man made the word sound like a curse. \"I think birthing does something to your minds. You are all mad.\" He laughed. It was a bitter sound. \"Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes. Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof.\" He paused a moment. \"Or does she?\"   \"Do you think the king will require proof?\" the woman said. \"I tell you, he loves me not.\"   \"And whose fault is that, sweet sister?\"   Bran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as he fell past, pull himself up . . . except that might make a noise, draw them to the window. He was not sure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant for his ears.   \"You are as blind as Robert,\" the woman was saying.   \"If you mean I see the same thing, yes,\" the man said. \"I see a man who would sooner die than betray his king.\"   \"He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?\" the woman said. \"Oh, I don\\'t deny he\\'s loyal to Robert, that\\'s obvious. What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne? And the sooner that comes to pass, the safer we\\'ll all be. My husband grows more restless every day. Having Stark beside him will only make him worse. He\\'s still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old. How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?\"   Bran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come, to find his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to get closer, Bran realized. He had to see who was talking.   The man sighed. \"You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand.\"   \"Stop that!\" the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the man\\'s laughter.   Bran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof. This was the easy way. He moved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of the room where they were talking.   \"All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,\" the man said. \"Come here and be quiet.\"   Bran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself around, upside down. He hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window. The world looked strange upside down. A courtyard swam dizzily below him, its stones still wet with melted snow.   Bran looked in the window.   Inside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. Bran could not tell who they were. The man\\'s back was to him, and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall.   There were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed and frightened, his breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting her there, because the woman started to moan, low in her throat. \"Stop it,\" she said, \"stop it, stop it. Oh, please . . . \" But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast.   Bran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden hair swung from side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still he recognized the queen.   He must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring right at him. She screamed.   Everything happened at once then. \\' The woman pushed the man away wildly, shouting and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up, bending double as he reached for the gargoyle. He was in too much of a hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There was an instant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He shot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his other hand. He swung against the building, hard. The impact took the breath out of him. Bran dangled, one-handed, panting.   Faces appeared in the window above him.   The queen. And now Bran recognized the man beside her. They looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror.   \"He saw us,\" the woman said shrilly.   \"So he did,\" the man said.   Bran\\'s fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. Fingernails dug into unyielding stone. The man reached down. \"Take my hand,\" he said. \"Before you fall.\"   Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked him up to the ledge. \"What are you doing?\" the woman demanded.   The man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. \"How old are you, boy?\"   \"Seven,\" Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man\\'s forearm. He let go sheepishly.   The man looked over at the woman. \"The things I do for love,\" he said with loathing. He gave Bran a shove.   Screaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to grab on to. The courtyard rushed up to meet him.   Somewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken tower, waiting for corn.']"

       "'    The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king\\'s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\\'s life.   The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran\\'s skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.   But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king\\'s justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night\\'s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy.   The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he\\'d seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.   Bran\\'s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\\'s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.   There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. \"Ice,\" that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man\\'s hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.   His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, \"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die.\" He lifted the greatsword high above his head.   Bran\\'s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \"Keep the pony well in hand,\" he whispered. \"And don\\'t look away. Father will know if you do.\"   Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.   His father took off the man\\'s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched.   The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\\'s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away.   \"Ass,\" Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\\'s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. \"You did well,\" Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice.   It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses.   \"The deserter died bravely,\" Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\\'s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \"He had courage, at the least.\"   \"No,\" Jon Snow said quietly. \"It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\" Jon\\'s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast.   Robb was not impressed. \"The Others take his eyes,\" he swore. \"He died well. Race you to the bridge?\"   \"Done,\" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went.   Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man\\'s eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb\\'s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again.   So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him. \"Are you well, Bran?\" he asked, not unkindly.   \"Yes, Father,\" Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \"Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he was afraid.\"   \"What do you think?\" his father asked.   Bran thought about it. \"Can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\"   \"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" his father told him. \"Do you understand why I did it?\"   \"He was a wildling,\" Bran said. \"They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\"   His lord father smiled. \"Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night\\'s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\"   Bran had no answer for that. \"King Robert has a headsman,\" he said, uncertainly.   \"He does,\" his father admitted. \"As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\\'s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does not deserve to die.   \"One day, Bran, you will be Robb\\'s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\"   That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at them. \"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\" Then he was gone again.   Jory rode up beside them. \"Trouble, my lord?\"   \"Beyond a doubt,\" his lord father said. \"Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\" He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after.   They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices.   The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven ground . Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \"Gods!\" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword.   Jory\\'s sword was already out. \"Robb, get away from it!\" he called as his horse reared under him.   Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \"She can\\'t hurt you,\" he said. \"She\\'s dead, Jory.\"   Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran.   By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. \"What in the seven hells is it?\" Greyjoy was saying.   \"A wolf,\" Robb told him.   \"A freak,\" Greyjoy said. \"Look at the size of it.\"   Bran\\'s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers\\' side.   Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\\'s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\\'s kennel.   \"It\\'s no freak,\" Jon said calmly. \"That\\'s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\"   Theon Greyjoy said, \"There\\'s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\"   \"I see one now,\" Jon replied.   Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb\\'s arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb\\'s chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. \"Go on,\" Robb told him. \"You can touch him.\"   Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \"Here you go.\" His half brother put a second pup into his arms. \"There are five of them.\" Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek.   \"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\" muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \"I like it not.\"   \"It is a sign,\" Jory said.   Father frowned. \"This is only a dead animal, Jory,\" he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. \"Do we know what killed her?\"   \"There\\'s something in the throat,\" Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even asked. \"There, just under the jaw.\"   His father knelt and groped under the beast\\'s head with his hand. He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with blood.   A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand.   His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \"I\\'m surprised she lived long enough to whelp,\" he said. His voice broke the spell.   \"Maybe she didn\\'t,\" Jory said. \"I\\'ve heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came.\"   \"Born with the dead,\" another man put in. \"Worse luck.\"   \"No matter,\" said Hullen. \"They be dead soon enough too.\"   Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay.   \"The sooner the better,\" Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \"Give the beast here, Bran.\"   The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \"No!\" Bran cried out fiercely. \"It\\'s mine.\"   \"Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\" Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, like the lord he would someday be. \"We will keep these pups.\"   \"You cannot do that, boy,\" said Harwin, who was Hullen\\'s son.   \"It be a mercy to kill them,\" Hullen said.   Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \"Hullen speaks truly, son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\"   \"No!\" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his father.   Robb resisted stubbornly. \"Ser Rodrik\\'s red bitch whelped again last week,\" he said. \"It was a small litter, only two live pups. She\\'ll have milk enough.\"   \"She\\'ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\"   \"Lord Stark,\" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. \"There are five pups,\" he told Father. \"Three male, two female.\"   \"What of it, Jon?\"   \"You have five trueborn children,\" Jon said. \"Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\"   Bran saw his father\\'s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.   Their father understood as well. \"You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\" he asked softly.   \"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\" Jon pointed out. \"I am no Stark, Father.\"   Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \"I will nurse him myself, Father,\" he promised. \"I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\"   \"Me too!\" Bran echoed.   The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \"Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not have you wasting the servants\\' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?\"   Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue.   \"You must train them as well,\" their father said. \"You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip a man\\'s arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?\"  \"Yes, Father,\" Bran said.   \"Yes,\" Robb agreed.   \"The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\"   \"They won\\'t die,\" Robb said. \"We won\\'t let them die.\"   \"Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It\\'s time we were back to Winterfell.\"   It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him.   Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.   \"What is it, Jon?\" their lord father asked.   \"Can\\'t you hear it?\"   Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.   \"There,\" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.   \"He must have crawled away from the others,\" Jon said.   \"Or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.   \"An albino,\" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"This one will die even faster than the others.\"   Jon Snow gave his father\\'s ward a long, chilling look. \"I think not, Greyjoy,\" he said. \"This one belongs to me.\"'"
